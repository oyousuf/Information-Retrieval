here' s my day so far : went to jail , lost the girl of my dreams , and got my butt kicked pretty good . still , things could be a lot worse . oh , that' s right . i' m falling to my death . guess they can' t . how' d it all come to this , you ask ? my end starts at the beginning . the very beginning . yes , that' s me . i had a fairly standard childhood .
i came from , what you might call , a broken home . literally broken . i was eight days old and still living with my parents . how sad is that ? clearly it was time to move on . here is your minion . he will take care of you . and here is your binky . you are destined for … i didn' t quite hear that last part , but it sounded important . … two , one . – destined for what ?
i set out to find my destiny . turns out a kid from the glaupunkt quadrant had the exact same idea . that was the day i met mr goody two- shoes … and our glorious rivalry was born . could this be what i was destined for ? a dream life filled with luxury . apparently not . even fate picks its favorites . no big deal . a much different fate awaited me . a baby !
how thoughtful . oh , yes . yes , i saw it and thought of you . luckily i found a lovely little place to call home . can we keep it ? a place that taught me the differences between right … and wrong . mr goody two- shoes , on the other hand , had life handed to him on a silver platter . our baby can fly . yes , yes , nothing but the best for you , darling . the power of flight , invulnerability , and great hair .
but i had something far , far greater . my amazing intellect … and knack for building objects of mayhem . after a few years , and with some time off for good behavior , i was given an opportunity to better myself through learning … at a strange place called shool . it was there that i once again ran into mr goody two- shoes . he had already amassed a gigantic army of soft- headed groupies . he bought their affections with showmanship and extravagant gifts of deliciousness . so i , too , will make this popp- ed corn and win over those mindless drones . lights out . that' s when i learned a very hard lesson :
good receives all the praise and adulation , while evil is sent to quiet- time in the corner . so fitting in wasn' t really an option . while they were learning the itsy bitsy spider … i learned how to dehydrate animate objects and rehydrate them at will . some days , it felt like it was just me and minion against the world . no matter how hard i tried , i was always the odd man out , the last one picked , the screw- up , the black sheep … get him ! … the bad boy . – freak ! was this my destiny ? wait , maybe it was .
being bad is the one thing i' m good at . then it hit me : if i was the bad boy , then i was going to be the baddest boy of them all . i was destined to be a super- villain , and we were destined to be rivals . the die had been cast , and so began an enduring , epic , lifelong career . and i loved it . our battles quickly got more elaborate . he would win some . i would almost win others . he took the name metro man , defender of metrocity .
i decided to pick something a little more humble : megamind … incredibly handsome criminal genius and master of all villainy . read on your own time . open up . oh , good morning , warden . great news : i' m a changed man , and … and i' m ready to re- enter society as a solid citizen . you' re a villain , and you' il always be a villain . you' il never change , and you' il never leave . you' re fun .
you got a present in the mail . is it a puppy ? from metro man . “ to count every second of your 85 life sentences . ” that' s funny . never thought metro man was the gloating type . oh , but he does have nice taste . i think i' il keep it . any chance you could give me the time ? i don' t want to be late for the opening of the metro man museum . oh no .
looks like you' re gonna miss it , by several thousand years . oh , am i ? happy metro man day , metro city . it' s a beautiful day in beautiful downtown , where we' re here to honor a beautiful man , metro man . his heart is an ocean that' s inside a bigger ocean . for years he' s been watching us with his super- vision , saving us with his super- strength and caring for us with his super- heart . now it' s our turn to give something back . this is roxanne ritchi , reporting live from the dedication of the metro man museum . ok , the stuff they make you read on- air , that' s un- freaking- believable . it' s crazy .
i wrote that piece myself , hal . what i was trying to say was , i can' t believe that in our modern society , they let , like , actual art get onto the news . – nice save , hal . – what are we … like , let' s just get a coffee or something . come on , it' s time to get in the metro man day spirit . well , if i were metro man , megamind wouldn' t be kidnapping you all the time . – that' s the first thing . – that' s sweet , hal . and i' d be watching you , like a dingo watches a human baby . ok , that sounded … – ok , that sounded a little weird . – a little bit . the point is , i would watch you like someone …
not love . we' re not in love . i' m not saying i love you . hey , i love you . whatever . but i' m not saying like i' m in love with you . roxanne ? roxaroo ? get back to work . the city doesn' t pay you to loaf . – freeze ! – whoa .
what are you doing , guys ? it' s me ! it' s the warden . hey ! open up ! no , you fools . he' s tricked us . you were right . i' il always be a villain . well , hello good- looking .
need a lift ? certainly do , you fantastic fish , you . – get in the car , you . – i' m free ! right ? nice work sending me the watch , minion . – you got it , boss . – punch it ! all right , put your hands in the air . ladies and gentlemen , your metro man ! – who' s your man ? – metro man ! yeah , metro city ! gimme some . come on . give it now .
give it to me . right on . gimme the good stuff . hey , metro city . hey . hey . you know , you know , i just want to bring it down a bit . boys , a little lower . thank you , fellas . let' s get real for a moment .
that' s right . that' s right . that' s right . although getting a whole museum is super- cool , is super- cool , you want to know what the greatest honor you' ve given me is ? do you really want to know ? really ? i' il tell you . the greatest honor you' ve given me is letting me serve you , the helpless people of metro city . and at the end of every day , well , i often ask myself … who would i be without you ? – i love you , metro man ! – and i love you , random citizen . i tell you , minion .
there' s no place like evil lair . i' ve kept it cold and damp just for you , sir . how do i look , minion ? do i look bad ? disgustingly horrifying , sir . you always know what to say . oh , the brain- bots certainly missed you , sir . did you miss your daddy ? who' s a menacing little cyborg ? you are .
yes , you are . no biting . no , no , no , no , no , no . you want the wrench ? go get the wrench . – oh , look at that . – now , back to laughing . she' s awake . quick , to work . miss ritchi , we meet again . would it kill you to wash the bag ? you can scream all you wish , miss ritchi .
i' m afraid no one can hear you . wh … why isn' t she screaming ? miss ritchi , if you don' t mind ? like this … but that' s , that' s a poor lady scream . he' s a little better . is there some kind of nerdy super- villain web site where you get tesla coils and blinky dials ? actually , most of it comes from an outlet store in … don' t answer that . – romania . – don' t ! stop !
she' s using her nosy reporter skills on your weak- willed mind to find out all our secrets . such tricks won' t work on me … – please talk slower . – temptress . what secrets ? you' re so predictable . predictable ? predictable ? oh , you call this predictable ? your alligators . yes . yeah , i was thinking about it on the way over .
what' s this ? boom ! in your face . – cliché . – no ! look , watch . – juvenile . – shock and awe . – tacky . – oh , it' s so scary ! – seen it . – what' s this one do ? garish . – ok , the spider' s new . – spider ? yes . the … the spee- ider . even the smallest bite from arachnis deathicus will instantly paralyze … get it off !
it bit me ! give it up , megamind . your plans never work . let' s stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights , shall we ? it is with great pleasure that i present to metro man his new museum . if you please . – metro man ! – hey ! my kid can' t see . – megamind ! – oh , bravo , metro man . yes , i can play along too .
boo ! should' ve known you' d try to crash the party . oh , i intend to do more than crash it . this is a day you and metrocity shall not soon forget . it' s pronounced metro city ! potato- tomato , potato- tomato . we all know how this ends : with you behind bars . i' m shaking in my custom baby seal leather boots . you will leave metrocity , or this will be the last you ever hear of roxanne ritchi . roxanne !
don' t panic , roxie . – i' m on my way . – yeah , i' m not panicking . in order to stop me , you need to find me first , metro man . we' re at the abandoned observatory . no , we' re not ! don' t listen to her . she' s crazy . metro man approaching , sir . hold on a second . oh , good heavens ! you didn' t think you were in the real observatory , did you ?
ready the death ray , minion . death ray , readying . over here , old friend . in case you haven' t noticed , you' ve fallen right into my trap . you can' t trap justice . it' s an idea , a belief . even the most heartfelt belief can be corroded over time . justice is a non- corrosive metal . but metals can be melted by the heat of revange . it' s “ revenge , ” and it' s best served cold .
but it can be easily reheated in the microwave of evil . well , i think your warranty is about to expire . maybe i got an extended warranty . warranties are invalid if you don' t use the product for its intended purpose . oh , girls , girls , you' re both pretty . can i go home now ? of course . that is , if metro man can withstand the full , concentrated power of the sun ! fire ! minion .
fire ? – it' s still warming up , sir . – come again ? – warming up , sir . – warming up ? the sun is warming up ? one second more and … just tippy- tappy tippy- tap- tap , tip- top more , and we are ready in just … – honestly ! on my way , roxie . i told you to have things ready . i told you countless times . why do you always blame me ? my spider bite is acting up . your plan is failing . just admit it .
yeah , good luck with that one . whose side are you on ? – the losing side . – thank you . could someone stamp my frequent kidnapping card ? you of all people know we discontinued that promotion . – ciao- ciao , all ! – same time next week ? crab nuggets ! – what did he just say ? – “ crab nuggets ” ? ten seconds to full power . – good lord , i' m trapped . – ten … – what kind of trickery is this ? – … nine … – you mad genius . – … eight … – your dark gift has finally paid off . – … seven … – it … it has ? – … six … this dome is obviously lined with copper . – yeah ? so ? – sir … – copper drains my powers . – … two … – your weakness is copper ? – … one . – you' re kidding , right ? – full power . i don' t think even he could survive that . well , let' s not get our hopes up just yet . – look ! – metro man !
metro man . metro man ! – you … you did it , sir . – i did it ? he did it . – i did it ? – he did it . – you did it , sir . – i did it ! – you did it ! – i did it ! metrocity is mine ! – you did it , sir ! – i did it ! yeah , me , me ! – yes , i did it ! – us ! we both did it ! – not us ! i ! – you , a little more than me but still , come on ! – a lot more than you . when they' re giving out the awards , – i' m gonna be right there next to you . – what awards ?
hit it ! drop ' em ! first off , what a turnout . how wild is this ? all i did was eliminate the most powerful man in the universe . are there any questions ? go on . yes ! you in the back . i' m sure we' d all like to know what you plan to do with us and this city .
good , i' m glad you asked that . imagine the most horrible , terrifying , evil thing you can possibly think of , and multiply it … by six ! in the meantime , i want you to carry on with the dreary , normal things you normal people do . let' s just have fun with this . come on . and i will get back to you . now slam the door really hard . they … they can still see you . – now ? – your elbow' s still in . there he is , mr evil overlord
oh , minion , did you think this day would ever come ? no way . not at all , sir . never . never in a million … i mean … – yes , i did . – look at the intricate mouldings . i' m looking . and what' s this ? it' s like one of the giant monitors in the lair . but it seems to only carry one station . oh , that , sir , is called a window . – window ? – all the kids are looking through them .
i' ve never had a view before . metrocity , minion , it' s all mine . if my parents could see me now . sir , i' m sure they' re smiling down from evil heaven . and now that mr goody two- shoes is out of the way , i can have everything i want , and there' s no one to stop me ! i know . i know . always thirsty , never satisfied . i understand you , little well- dressed bird .
purposeless , emptiness . it' s a vacuum , isn' t it ? it' s … what' s your vacuum like ? hey , hey , hey , hey ! not now , minion . i' m in a heated , existential discussion with this dead- eyed , plastic desk toy . is … is something wrong , sir ? just think about it . we have it all . yet , we have nothing .
it' s just too easy now . i' m sorry , you' ve lost me , sir . i mean , we did it , right ? well , you did it , sir . yes , you' ve made that perfectly clear . then why do i feel so … mel- on- choly . “ mel- on- choly ” ? – unhappy . – well … what if tomorrow , we could go kidnap roxanne ritchi . that always seems to lift your spirits . good idea , minion . but without him , what' s the point ? – “ him , ” sir ? – nothing .
we' il just … that' s something to consider … and … well , i think i' il just power down for a while then . he was always there for us . dependable . perhaps we took him for granted . you know , maybe , we never really know how good we have it until it' s gone . we miss you , metro man . i miss you . and i have just one question for megamind : are you happy now ? this is roxanne ritchi , reporting from a city without a hero .
coming up next , are you ready to be a slave army ? and … wrap that up and give it to a child on christmas , ' cause we' re done . – ok . see you tomorrow , hal . wait . roxie , i' m having a party at my house . it' s gonna be , like , off the hook , or whatever . you should come over . i got a deejay , rented a bouncy house , made a gallon of dip . it' s gonna be sick .
i … i don' t know , hal . i don' t really feel like being around a bunch of people . no , no , no , that' s the best part . it' il just be like you and me . that … that' s certainly very tempting , but … i did hire a wedding photographer . that' s just in case we were like , something crazy happened and we wanted a picture of it . like , maybe we should have this for , like , ever . like a memory , you know ? i' m gonna pass .
i have some work here that i need to do , anyway . cool . so thursday ? soft thursday ? – good night , hal . – that' s a soft yes on thursday . what' s wrong with me ? rented a bouncy house ? chicks don' t like bouncy houses . they like clowns . stupid van ! you broke my finger !
i' ve made a horrible mistake . i didn' t mean to destroy you . i mean , i meant to destroy you , but i didn' t think it would really work . what are we supposed to do ? without you , evil is running rampant through the streets . i' m so tired of running rampant through the streets . what' s the point of being bad when there' s no good to try and stop you ? someone has to stop megamind . – hey , we' re closing soon . – you scared me . – barry , right ? – bernard . bernard . i was just … well , i was talking to myself .
you probably think i' m a little bit nuts . i' m not allowed to insult guests directly . thank you . just … bernard , i' il just be another minute . ok . thanks . i had so many evil plans in the works . the illiteracy beam . typhoon cheese . robo- sheep .
battles we will now never have . you know , i never had the chance to say goodbye . so it' s good that we have this time now . you know , before i destroy the place . nothing personal , it just brings back too many painful memories . hello ? – hello ? – roxanne . – that' s a pretty tasteless costume . – costume ? megamind' s head is not that grossly exaggerated . and you even made a cheap replica of his dehydration gun . hello ?
is someone there ? who' s there ? it' s just you , bernard . yes . it' s just me . bernard . well , thank you for letting me stay . look , i wouldn' t stay here for more than two minutes and 37 seconds if i were you . we' re having the walls and ceiling removed . wow , that sounds like quite the renovation .
i guess i' il catch a ride down with you then . i kept thinking he was gonna do one of his last- minute escapes . he was really good at those . oh , if only the world had a reset button . i' ve looked into the reset button . the science is impossible . oh , bernard … i didn' t know you had … feelings . are you ok ? metro man' s gone .
and now there' s no one left to challenge megamind . oh , come on , bernard . as long as there' s evil , good will rise up against it . oh , i wish . i believe someone is gonna stand up to megamind . – you really think so ? – yeah . i mean , it' s like they say , “ heroes aren' t born , they' re made . ” heroes can be made . that' s it ! all you need are the right ingredients . – yeah . bravery . – yes . – strength . – of course . – determination . – imperative !
and a smidgen of dna . oh , with that , anyone can be a hero ! yeah ! i think we should run ! bye ! time to put the past behind us . only the future … i' m too close ! i' m genuinely scared right now . i hope no one' s seeing this !
create a hero ? wait , wait , what ? why would you do that ? so i have someone to fight . minion , i' m a villain without a hero . a yin with no yang . a bullfighter with no bull to fight . in other words , i have no purpose . now , ask me how i' m going to do it . go on !
ask ! how are you gonna do it ? i' m going to give someone … i don' t know who yet … metro man' s powers . i' m going to train that someone to become metrocity' s new hero . over here ! follow ! and then finally , i' m going to fight that hero in an epic battle of good and evil . which will put everything back the way it was … when the world was perfect and rosy . behold , minion , metro man' s cape .
look closely . tell me what you see . – dandruff ? – yes . it' s his dna . from this , we' il extract the source of metro man' s awesome power . sir , i think this is a bad idea . yes ! this is a very wickedly bad idea for the greater good of man . but i' m saying this is a kind of bad that … ok , you might think is good in your bad perception , but from a good perception it … it' s just plain bad . oh , you don' t know what' s good for bad .
now , we have just one shot at this . we must find a suitable subject , someone of noble heart and mind . who puts the welfare of others above their own . what on earth is that ? it seems to be emanating from there , sir . ollo . it' s “ hello . ” hello ? like that ? – bernard , it' s roxanne . – it' s roxanne . i just wanted to thank you for inspiring me the other day . – oh , you inspired me too . – great !
it' s time we stood up to megamind and show him he can' t push us around . oh , really ? she' s so cute . i' m already hot on his trail . – and what gives you that idea ? – sir ? i just found his secret hideout . how did she find my hideout ⁈ how did you find his hideout ? this is the only building in metro city with a fake observatory on the roof . there' s no way she' il find the secret entrance . there' s a doormat here that says “ secrit entrance ” !
– minion ! – i kept forgetting where it was . she' il discover all our secrets ! – oh , no ! – you dim- witted creation of science ! – what ? – what ? oh , no , not you , roxanne . no , i was just yelling at my … mother' s urn . don' t do anything . i' il be right there . roxanne ? oh no , not again ! roxanne ? i' m glad you' re here .
wait , how did you get here so fast ? well , i … i happened to be speed walking nearby when you called . in a suit ? it' s called … formal speed walking , but that' s not important . i better take the lead . this way looks exciting . no , it says “ exit . ” which is the abbreviation for “ exciting , ” right ? this is the mother lode ! – wow . just look at this thing . – wow .
you know , i really could use your help in deciphering all this . – really ? – you' re an expert … on all things megamind , right ? – yes . right . together , we could figure out his plan for the city and stop it . – are you in ? – oh , what fun ! that' s what i want to hear . minion , code : send in the brain- bots . you know , the whole point of a code is … oh , code : just do it , minion . intruder ! – it' s me , you fools ! – bernard !
it' s daddy ! megamind . – what have you done with bernard ? – oh , bernard ? oh , yes . i' m doing horrible things to that man . i don' t want to get into it , but lasers , spikes . no , please ! no ! not the lasers and the spikes ! – you know the drill . – oh , no ! not the drill ! – let him go or … – or what ? or i' m gonna find out what this weird- looking gun does .
no , don' t shoot ! don' t shoot that gun ! i' il just go get him . – unhand me , you fiend ! – never ! his strength' s too much ! oh , i work out ! well , it' s really paying off ! you' re so fit , and strangely charismatic . are you ok ? i did my best , but he' s too fantastic . here .
let me carry that heavy gun for you . i got us covered . – let go . it' s mine ! – bernard , run ! roxanne ? – you' re going to break it ! – give it to me ! oh , no ! roxanne ⁈ who on earth is that ? – help ! – roxanne ! bernard !
you were right about that door being exciting . – intruder ! intruder ! – this way . intruder ! what are you doing ? this' il stop them . here ! seems a bit extreme , doesn' t it ? – just throw it ! – daddy' s sorry . that was really exciting . – yeah . – you were very strong in there . – i know . i' ve never seen anyone but metro man stand up to him like that . – what' s going on ? – hal , what happened ?
i think a bee flew up my nose . i was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you , but like 50 ninjas tried to attack me , so i had to beat ' em all up , and i did , and i … they were all , like , crying and stuff … – wow , a brave one , isn' t he ? – who are you ? oh , thi … this is bernard . he' s my partner . – partner ? – yes . yes . partner . well , look , “ partner , ” i' m her partner . she doesn' t know what she' s saying . she' s been through a traumatic experience . i' d better take him home .
thanks again , bernard . i' il call you tomorrow , partner . yeah , ok . i' d like that . that was weird for everybody , ' cause you accidentally hugged him instead of me . sir ? sir ! code : did you find out who it was ?
code : get the car . code : right away , sir . – bye- bye ! – see you tomorrow , hal . i' il leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later . who is this man we' ve infused with godlike power ? well , sir , his name' s hal stewart . he' s 28 years old . no criminal record .
actually no records at all . apparently this man hasn' t accomplished anything . not yet , minion . not … yet . could this day get anymore fun- tastic ? so , i will just go ahead and diffuse him since this is clearly a mistake . no , minion ! there' s something much more powerful at work here . this is no mistake . it' s destiny .
hal shtewart ! prepare for your destiny ! hal ? hal shtewart ? – hey ! in the bed ! – am i saying it right ? “ stewart . ” is this a robbery ? ' cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me . oh , look , it' s hal stewart . quick , the spray . all out . – well , use the forget- me stick . – oh , right .
just look at him . no , he doesn' t look quite the hero- type to me . oh , you' re such a pill , minion . a potter couldn' t ask for finer clay . i smell a hero . i smell something burning . i think it' s working . places ! places ! places !
places ! do you have your disguise ? what ? oh , you look fantastic . rise my glorious creation . rise , and come to papa . – what' s going on ? – easy my child . – who are you ? – i sent you to this planet to teach you about justice , honor , and nobility . i am your father . so you' re like my space dad ? yeah , i' m like your space dad . and you are what ?
i' m your space step- mom . i' ve had some work done recently . is this some kind of dream ? this is a dream come true . you' ve been blessed with unfathomable power . – what kind of power ? – unfathomable . it' s unf … without fathom . we' ve come to guide you on your path to be metrocity' s new hero and battle the super- genius of megamind . i know this is a lot to take in . it may take months for you to come to grips . no freaking way !
i wasn' t finished . i' m gonna be a hero ! i' m gonna be a hero ! see , minion , he' s perfect ! and … action ! – someone help me ! – i' m ok ! zap ! zap ! zap ! the flames of my evil burn bright . now you say something cool back at me .
look . it doesn' t even hurt . don' t even feel it . no , no , no , no , no . stomach down , hands up . like metro man . – whoa ! wait ! – watch out . he' s hopeless . hopeless ! – maybe we should change tactics . – you think so ? oh , you know how boys are .
they love video games . – i could throw a few parts together . – can' t wait . smiley face . can' t wait for what , sir ? that was such a funny story . and brilliantly told , by the way . ok , now you tell one . bernard , i never knew you were so funny . and i never heard you laugh before . yeah , it' s been a while . feels pretty good .
and action . – you don' t get out much , do you ? – oh , what fun ! i used to come here with my mother when i was a kid . it was one of my favorite things to do . now look at it . it' s a dump . why are we cleaning up the city , sir ? well , we don' t want to battle our new hero in a dump now , do we ? they' re all back . but how ?
why ? maybe megamind isn' t so bad after all . that' s it . be free , my beautiful dove ! metro man and i were never a couple . – but i thought you two were … – i know . everybody did . it' s just … well , he was never really my type . really ? ok , now you tell me something . something you' ve never told anyone .
well , in sh … school … none of the other kids really liked me . i was always the last one picked for everything . it' s too bad that we didn' t go to the same school . hal , i think you' re ready for this . – do i have a son ? – no . you make me laugh . it stretches . it' s for you . hey , what' s the t stand for ? titan . “ titan ” ?
it was the only name i could trademark . do you have someone special in your life , hal ? no , not yet . but … there' s this really , really good- looking one i' ve got my eye on currently . that' s very good . – romance is very inspiring . – that' s what i hear . all you have to do is save her and she' il be yours . – who wants churros ? – i do ! – i do , yeah . thanks , space step- mom . – churros all the way around . on the count of three , unsheathe your churro . one , two , three !
to titan ! tomorrow , you will fight megamind , and the city will know your name . the city' s parks restored to their original glory , the streets the safest they' ve been , the banks reopened . has something happened to megamind ? has someone tamed this monster ? this is roxanne ritchi , cautiously optimistic , and pleasantly confused . well , you seem in a very good mood tonight , sir . oh , yes . how long is this going to take , minion ? just a few alterations , sir , and i will be done with your most terrifying cape yet !
i' m calling it … the black mamba … black mamba . perfect . gosh , i am running late . i have to go . what ? where … where are you going , sir ? we have our debut battle with titan tomorrow morning . we haven' t even tested your big battle suit yet . you attend to the details , minion .
i have to … run a quick errand . you don' t run errands . – what' s going on here ? – what ? oh , wait a minute . are you wearing jean paul gaultier' s pour homme ? it' s just my natural musk . now , where are the car keys ? this is about ms ritchi , isn' t it ? you' re going on a date with her . no , my main man . get out of town .
oh , this is bad . this is bad . you' ve fallen in love with her . you are forgetting your place , minion . now give me the keys . what happens when roxanne finds out who you really are ? she will never find out . that' s the point of lying . honestly , if i didn' t know any better , i' d think this was your first day of being evil .
no ! this has gone far enough ! oh , that was really grown- up ! sir , sir , please . it' s for your own good . oh , what do you know ? i may not know much , but i do know this : the bad guy doesn' t get the girl . maybe i don' t want to be the bad guy anymore . you heard me !
who are you ? – now , give me the keys ! – no ! my sole purpose in life is to look after you . well , i don' t need you to look after me . what are you s … what are you saying ? you don' t need me ? let me make it clear . code : i don' t need you . you know what ? you know what ?
code : i' il just pack my thing and go ! – code : fine ! – code : fine back ! – well , good luck on your date ! – i will ! – that doesn' t even make any sense ! – i know ! i know i am so close . i can feel it . ok , ok . i just have to take a step back . wait a minute .
“ titan . ” – what' s a titan ? – my super- ears are burning . i usually just hear criminals . you haven' t been naughty , have you ? i' m totally messing with you . i' m totally messing with you . – the name' s titan . – titan . your very own heroic guardian of pure awesome . what' s your name ? just kidding . i know everything about you . and i … and i brought some flowers .
didn' t know what you liked , so i just grabbed , you know , all of them . ok . you don' t like flowers ? ok , forget the flowers . what do you want ? thought maybe we could go for a little flight around town . get to know each other first . this must be very thrilling for you . what do you think you' re doing ⁈ oh , am i moving too fast ?
you' re probably right . i should just rescue you a few times before we get all romantic . saved ya . you are lucky to have such a great hero here . – don' t you ever … – oh , no ! somebody do something ! oh , right , right , duh . i gotcha . that was a close one . you almost died , but i saved you . – building ! gotcha !
i' m sorry . what were you saying ? i couldn' t hear you over the sound of me saving your life . put me down ! right now ! ok , all right . all right , hold on . are you crazy ? i suppose i' m a , i' m a little crazy , about you . who are you , really ?
oh , right . well , prepare to have your mind blown , little lady . – ta- da . – hal ? yeah . isn' t this great ? now there' s nothing keeping us apart . – no . it' s not great . – wow . our first fight . this is so us . we' re like an old married couple .
look , there is no “ us , ” ok ? there will never be an “ us . ” but … i have powers . i have a cape . i' m the good guy . you are a good guy , hal , but you don' t understand . – we need to find out why … – no , no . this … – hal , just take a deep breath … – this isn' t right ! – … and listen to me for a moment . – you' re supposed to be with me ! i' m trying to warn you , hal . it' s titan ! it' s titan , not hal !
– bernard . – roxanne . – sorry i' m late . – wow , your hair looks exciting . not the only exciting development of the night . megamind' s created a new hero , and i know why . it all makes sense now . he missed getting his butt kicked , so he created a new hero to kick it for him . – yeah . but why would he pick hal ? hal is the worst possible person you could pick . wow . that' s a lot to take in . it boggles my mind .
i am extremely boggled . you know , i' m sure we' il get to the bottom of who' s kicking whose butt . but in the meantime , let' s enjoy each other' s company . i' m sorry , bernard , of course , you' re right . you know , i could use a breather . to bernard , for being the only normal thing in my crazy , upside- down world . to … being normal . – roxanne ? – yes ? say i wasn' t so normal . let' s say i was bald and had the complexion of , of a popular primary color , as a random , nonspecific example .
– would you still enjoy my company ? – of course ! you don' t judge a book by its cover or a person from the outside . that' s a relief to hear . you judge them based on their actions . well , that seems kind of petty , don' t you think ? what ? what ? don' t look at me ! just a technical glitch ! don' t look yet !
well , never mind that . where were we ? – you … – now , now , hold on . you ! i can explain ! what about everything you just said ? about judging a book by its cover ? well , let' s take a look at the contents then , shall we ? you destroyed metro man , you took over the city , and then , you actually got me to care about you ! why are you so evil ?
tricking me ? what could you possibly hope to gain ? wait a minute . i don' t believe this . do you really think that i would ever be with you ? no . ok , minion ! you were right ! i was … less right ! we should stick to what we' re good at … being bad .
minion ? you there ! yeah , you . bring out the black mamba . ok , titan . it' s time to go down in style . i hear there' s a new hero who dares challenge my evil . where is the one they call titan ? challenge me if you dare ! oh no .
we' re gonna crash ! this is embarrassing . of all the inconsiderate , bone- headed … irresponsible , rude … unprofessional , that' s what this is ! would metro man have kept me waiting ? of course not ! he was a pro ! hey , megamind ! you' re actually the guy i want to see . also , there' s a door here .
do you have any idea how long i waited for you ? no , no , no , i totally understand what you' re saying . could you just , just shut up for one second . i' m trying to beat this level . were you even planning on showing up ? what' s this ? where did you get all this stuff ? it doesn' t belong to me . – you stole it ? – pretty cool , right ? – no , no , no , no ! you' re a hero ! – being a hero is for losers ! it' s work , work , work , 24/ 7 , and for what ?
i only took the gig to get the girl , and it turns out roxanne doesn' t want anything to do with me . – roxanne ritchi ? – yeah ! roxanne ritchi ! i saw her having dinner and making googly eyes at some intellectual dweeb ! who needs all that noise ? that' s why i think we should team up . you … wait … what ? with my power , and your big- headedness , we could rule the city ! – you want to team up ? i even drew up some new costume designs , see ? – costume designs ? – you' d be the brains , so you' d get a little brain , wearing glasses on your costume , or something . and since i' m the cool one , i' d have , like , two tanks swordfighting … i can' t believe you .
all your gifts , all your powers , and you … you squander them for your own personal gain . – yes ! – no ! i' m the villain ! i do something bad , and you come and get me ! that' s why i created you . yeah , right . you' re nuts . space dad told me … look , i' m your space dad ! you should be more like metro man . – you tricked me ? – oh , don' t like that ?
well , there' s more . i' m also the intellectual dweeb dating roxanne . – no . – and we were smooching up a storm ! when i get my hands on you , i' m gonna … yes ! yes , i know ! bring me to justice . oh god , how i' ve missed this . and the hero strikes the first blow . but evil returns with a backhand ! yes !
come out , you little freak ! i want to see what that big brain looks like on the pavement ! you fell for the oldest evil trick in the book ! you little blue twerp ! en garde ! oh , now that' s the spirit ! parry ! thrust ! parry again ! now it' s time for some witty back and forth banter !
you go first ! look , i' m not sure where to go with that ! this one' s for stealing my girlfriend ! this one' s for space dad making a fool out of me ! and , megamind , this one' s for space step- mom ! well done . i thought that battle went really , really well . – i mean , i have a few notes . – notes ? but they can wait . you can take me to jail now . oh , no , no , no .
i was thinking more like the morgue . you' re dead ! whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . this isn' t how you play the game . game over . brain- bots ! i' m calling time out ! time out ? time out ! time out !
brain- bots , initiate the fail- safe . guess what , buster brown ? it' s made from copper . you' re powerless against it . it' s the very same metal used to defeat … metro man ? you should stop comparing me to metro man ! you can run , megamind , but you can' t hide ! we' re saved ! we' re saved ! what' s your name , new hero ? – it' s titan . – thank you !
thank you ! titan has freed us ! oh , i wouldn' t say “ free . ” more like under new management . – what do you want ? – titan' s turned evil . congratulations . another one of your genius plans has backfired on you . and why did my doorman let you up ? carlos . please , roxanne , no . no .
i need your help . why do you need my help ? because you' re the smartest person i know . but you can' t hide here . the copper should have worked . why didn' t the copper work ? the copper worked perfectly well last time . copper ? you' re not making any sense . look , if we don' t find titan' s weakness , he' il destroy the whole city .
– ok , how can i help ? – we need to find answers . you knew metro man best . did he have a hideout ? a cave ? a solitary fortress of some kind ? anything that would give us clues . well … there is one place i know . you gave him these powers . can' t you just take them away ? i can' t .
i lost my diffuser gun when i misplaced the invisible car . the night you dumped me . alone . in the rain . did you ever look back ? – no ! – my giant blue head ! i guess we' re here . so , this is where he hid it . after all these years . my old shool- house . you know , i think there' s an apology in order for the other night .
ok , that would be nice , but make it quick . we have much more pressing matters to deal with . wow . i can' t believe he kept all this stuff . i remember when he wore that . – shouldn' t we try to stay focused here ? – yes , of course . right . focused . come over and look at this . what is it ? what did you find ?
look . this glass has ice cubes in it . yes , that' s what happens when water gets cold . no , what i' m saying is , don' t you think it' s a little odd that the ice hasn' t melted yet ? one of life' s great mysteries . hey . we now have confirmed reports . titan , first thought to be this city' s new hero , has turned evil . the city has never seen this level of destruction . if only metro man were still alive . – you' re alive ? – you' re alive . – i' m alive . – but i , we …
we saw your skeleton ! you were dead ! are you a ghost ? there had better be an amazing explanation for this . speak , apparition . ok . ok , ok , ok . you both deserve the truth . it all started back at the observatory . roxanne was kidnapped .
i was gonna stop you . my head wasn' t in the game that day . we were kind of going through the motions . so … using my super- speed , i decided to go clear my head . fire ! then i realized , we had done this same silly charade our entire lives . i tried to get my mind off how i was feeling , but i just felt stuck . i began to realize , despite all my powers , each and every citizen of metro had something i didn' t : a choice . ever since i can remember , i' ve always had to be what the city wanted me to be .
but what about what i wanted to do ? then it suddenly hit me . i do have a choice . i can be whatever i want to be . no one said this hero thing had to be a lifetime gig . you can' t just quit , either . that' s when i got the brilliant idea … to fake my death . copper drains my powers . your weakness is copper ? once your death ray hit , i' d never felt so alive .
so i borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school . metro man was finally dead . and music man was born ! – music man ? – that way i could keep my logo . – ' cause of wha … ? – come again ? i was finally free to get in touch with my true power … weaving lyrical magic . check this out . i have eyes that can see right through lead … – you' re horrible ! – granted , you have talent . but there' s a madman out there destroying our … your city . how could you do this ⁈ the people of this city relied on you , and you deserted them !
you left us in the hands of him ! – no offense . – no , i' m with you . look , we need your help . i' m sorry . i really am . i' m done . you know , little buddy , there' s a yin for every yang . if there' s bad , good will rise up against it . it' s taken me a long time to find my calling . now it' s about time you find yours . hey , who needs him ?
we can beat titan ourselves . i say we go back to the evil lair , grab some ray guns , hold him sideways , and just go all gangsta on him . we can' t . so that' s it ? you' re just giving up ? i' m the bad guy . i don' t save the day , i don' t fly off into the sunset , and i don' t get the girl . i' m going home . unless someone comes to our aid soon , all may be lost . thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus .
remaining citizens are warned to stay indoors until further notice . authorities have issued a warning to stay out of the downtown area at all costs . hal ! hal ! let me guess . after seeing how awesome i am , you' ve finally come to your senses ? well , i' m over you . – i' ve come to stop you , hal . – you ? oh , wow . ok , what are you gonna do , report me to death ? i was going to try reasoning with you .
you and i , we worked together for a long time . i know you . you don' t know me . you never took the time to know me . this is the first time we' ve hung out socially , and it' s when i' m about to destroy the city ! i want to talk to the real hal . i want to talk to the guy who loved being a cameraman , and eating dip , and being a nerd , and being not as scary as the tighten hal . too late ! megamind ! you and i have some unfinished business .
i' il be waiting at metro tower . oh , and just so you don' t get cold feet … roxanne . come on , roxie , call for your hero to come rescue you . megamind , i don' t even know if you' re listening , but if you are , you can' t give up . the megamind i knew would never have run from a fight , even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning . it was your best quality . you need to be that guy right now . the city needs you . i need you .
roxanne . you have one hour . don' t keep me waiting . warden ! warden ! listen to me ! you have to let me go ! tighten has to be stopped ! sorry , megamind . you still have 88 life sentences to go .
plenty of time to reflect on what you' ve done . did you want to hear me say it ? i' il say it . here it is , from the blackest part of my heart . i am sorry ! not buying it . i don' t blame you . i' ve terrorized this city countless times . created a hero who' s turned out to be a villain . i lied to roxanne , and … my best friend minion , i treated like dirt .
please don' t make this city … don' t make roxanne pay for my wrongdoings . apology accepted . oh , minion , you fantastic fish , you . what are we waiting for ? we' d better get going . you got me . – good luck , fellas ! – we' re gonna die ! wait , what ? hey , metro losers . this is metro tower .
they say it' s supposed to be a symbol of our city' s strength . but for me , it' s a reminder of the day this woman ferociously ripped out my heart . and i hate reminders ! help ! please don' t do this . i know there' s still good in you , hal . you' re so naive , roxie . you see the good in everybody , even when it' s not there . you' re living a fantasy . there is no easter bunny , there is no tooth fairy , and there is no queen of england .
this is the real world , and you need to wake up ! you dare challenge megamind ? this town isn' t big enough for two super- villains ! oh , you' re a villain all right ! just not a super one ! yeah ? what' s the difference ? presentation ! – i knew you' d come back . – well , that made one of us . – what' s the plan ? – well , it mostly involves not dying .
i like that plan . building ! go faster ! make this thing go faster ! i can' t control it ! no . well , that was easy . looks like there' s only one loose end now . please , let' s have a little respect for public transportation . you came back !
you were right , roxanne . i never should have left . i … i thought you were dead . my death was … greatly exaggerated . so , you' re the punk i' ve heard about . i' m sorry . i did the best i could . i' m so proud of you . minion ? surprise !
he' s the real hero . megamind . going somewhere ? besides jail ? no , not in the face , man . please . if you know what' s good for you , tighten , you' il stay out of metrocity ! – you got it ! – for good ! pretty sneaky , sis . but there' s only one person i know who calls this town “ metrocity . ” you .
bet you think it' s really funny ? let' s all laugh at the really cool guy ? well , you' re not gonna be laughing for long . the invisible car . hey ! remember that night that i dumped you ? you' re bringing this up now ? well , i did look back ! you did ? you did ?
yes ! and you should look back right now ! oh , i get it ! this is the last time you make a fool out of me ! i made you a hero . you did the fool thing all by yourself . you' re so pathetic . no matter what side you' re on , you' re always the loser . there' s a benefit to losing . you get to learn from your mistakes .
oh , you' ve got to be kidding me ! minion , if i live , i will kill you . enjoy your flight ! megamind ! so this is how it ends . normally , i' d chalk this up to my last glorious failure . but not today . what can i say ? old habits die hard . say bye- bye , roxie .
ollo . the thing about bad guys , they always lose ! – you did it . you won . – well … i finally had a reason to win . you . minion ! can' t see . it' s cold and … warm , and dark and light . it' s me , minion .
i' m right here . we' ve had a lot of adventures together , you and i. we have , minion . i mean … most of them ended in horrible failure , but we won today . didn' t we , sir ? yes , minion , we did it . thanks to you . code : we' re the good guys now . code :
i guess we are . oh , oh , oh , i' m going ! i think this , this is it ! i' m going … going far … what a drama queen . you know , i' m feeling much better now . i guess i just needed a swim . he had you , didn' t he ? classic minion . don' t give me that face .
he reels you in with that little face . – look at that face . – we did it ! we did it ! – fist pump ! – you did it ! we won , we won , we won ! get back , you savages ! sorry ! sorry . he' s just not used to positive feedback . funny , i guess destiny is not the path given to us … but the path we choose for ourselves . all right , put your hands in the air . now hand over your wallets .
i' m just kidding ! just kidding ! i have to admit , being good has its perks . you know , you look pretty good in white . megamind , if you plea … my kid can' t see . sorry , my friend . way to go , little buddy . i knew he had it in him . ladies and gentlemen ,
megamind , defender of metro city ! you know , i like the sound of that . hit it ! i' m bad ! i' m bad ! sir , you really need to empty your pockets more often . this has been the worst day of my entire life . no worries . here' s my day , so far . went to jail , lost the girl of my dreams and got my butt kicked .
pretty good . still , things could be a lot worse . oh , that' s right , i' m falling to my death . guess they can' t . how did it all come to this , you ask ? my end starts at the beginning . the very beginning . yes , that' s me . i had a fairly standard childhood . i came from what you might call , a broken home .
literally , broken . i was eight days old and still living with my parents . how sad is that ? clearly it was time to move on . here is your , minion , he will take care of you . and here is your binkie . you are destined for ... i didn' t quite hear that last part . but it sounded important . destined for , what ?
i set out to find my destiny . turns out a kid from the blaupunkt quadrant had the exact same idea . that was the day i met , mr. goody- two- shoes . and our glorious rivalry , was born ! could this be what i was destined for ? a dream life filled with luxury ? apparently not . even fate picks its favorites . no big deal . a much different fate awaited me .
a baby . how thoughtful . oh yes , yes . i saw it and thought of you . luckily i found a lovely little place to call home . can we keep it ? a place that taught me the differences between right ... ... and wrong . mr. goody- two- shoes on the other hand , had life handed to him on a silver platter . our baby can fly . yes , yes .
nothing but the best for you , darling . the power of flight , invulnerability , and great hair . but i had something far , far greater , my amazing intellect . a knack for building objects of mayhem . after a few years , and with some time off for good behavior . i was given an opportunity to better myself through learning . at a strange place called shh- ool . it was there that i once again ran into mr. goody- two- shoes . he had already amassed a gigantic army of soft- headed groupies .
he bought their affections with showmanship , and extravagant gifts of deliciousness . so i too would make this ' popped- corn ' and win over those mindless dregs . lights out ! that' s when i learned a very hard lesson . good receives all the praise and adulation . while evil is sent to quiet time in the corner . so a fitting end wasn' t really an option . while they were learning the itsy bitsy spider . i learned how to dehydrate animate objects . and rehydrate them at will . some day’ s it felt like it was just me and minion , against the world .
no matter how hard i tried . i was always the odd man out . the last one picked . the screw- up , the black sheep . the bad boy . was this my destiny ? wait ! maybe it was . being bad is the one thing i' m good at . then it hit me .
if i was the bad boy . then i was going to be the baddest boy of them all . i was destined to be a super villain . and we were destined to be rivals . the die had been cast . and so began an enduring epic , life long career . and i loved it . our battles quickly got more elaborate . he would win some , i would almost win others . he took the name , metro man .
defender of montrosity . i decided to pick something a little more humble . megamind . incredibly handsome criminal genius , and master of all villainy . read on your own time . open up . oh , good morning , warden . great news , i' m a changed man . and i' m ready to re- enter society as a solid citizen . you' re a villain , and you' il always be a villain .
you' il never change . and you' il never leave . - you' re fun . - you got a present in the mail . is it a puppy ? from metro man . to count every second of your 85 life sentences . that' s funny , never thought metro man was the gloating type . oh but he does have nice taste . i think i' il keep it .
any chance you could give me the time ? i don' t want to be late for the opening of the metro man museum . oh no , looks like you' re gonna miss it . by several thousand years . oh , am i ? happy metro man day , metro city . it' s a beautiful day in beautiful downtown where we' re here to honor a beautiful man . metro man . his heart is an ocean that' s inside a bigger ocean . for years he' s been watching us with his super- vision .
saving us with his super strength , and caring for us with his super heart . now it' s our turn to give something back . this is roxanne ritchi reporting live , from the dedication of the metro man museum . wow , okay , the stuff they make you read on the air . that' s unfreaking believable , it' s crazy . i wrote that piece myself , hal . what i was trying to say was , i can' t believe that in our modern society they let like actual art get onto the news . - nice save , hal . - what are we , like lets just get a coffee or something .
come on , it' s time to get in the metro man day spirit . well , if i were metro man megamind wouldn' t be kidnapping you all the time . that' s the first thing . that' s sweet of you . and i' d be watching you , like a dingo watches a human baby . - mmm . - okay , that sounded , okay that sounded a little weird . a little bit , yeah . and you' re making a weird face , and that' s making me feel weird . not love , we' re not in love .
i' m not saying i love you . okay , i love you , whatever . i' m not saying like i' m in love with you . i' m saying ... roxanne ? roxaroo ? get back to work . the city doesn' t pay you to loaf . - freeze ! - whoa , what are you doing , guys ? it' s me !
it' s the warden . hey , open up . oh , you fools . he' s tricked us . you were right . i' il always be a villain . well hello good looking , need a lift ? certainly do , you fantastic fish you . get in the car , you . whoo , i' m free .
thanks for sending me the watch , minion . you got it , boss . punch it . all right , put your hands in the air . ladies and gentlemen , your metro man . - who' s your man ? - metro man . yeah , metro city ! give me some , come on give it now . give it to me .
what ? give it to me ... all right ! hey , metro city . hello , hey . you know , i just want you to bring it down a bit . boys , a little lower . thank you fellows . let' s get real for a moment . that' s right , that' s right ha , ha , that' s right . although getting a whole museum is super cool .
super cool , you want to know what the greatest honor you' ve given me is ? do you really want to know ? really ? i' il tell you . the greatest honor you' ve given me is ... ... letting me serve you . to help these people in metro city . and at the end of every day . ( sighs ) well . i often ask myself . who would i be , without you ?
man screams : i love you metro man ! and i love you , random citizen . i tell you minion , there' s no place like evil lair . i kept it cold and damp , just for you , sir . how do i look , minion ? - do i look bad ? - disgustingly horrifying , sir . you always know what to say . all the brain- bots certainly missed you , sir .
did you miss your daddy ? whose the menacing little brains ? you are , yes you are . uh , uh ! no biting , no , no , no . - no , no , no . you want the wrench ? go get the wrench . - oh , look at that . now , back to work .
she' s awake , quick , to work . - miss ritchi , we meet again . - would it kill you to wash the bag ? you can scream all you wish , miss ritchi . i' m afraid no one can hear you . wha .. why isn' t she screaming ? miss ritchi , if you don' t mind . like this ... ahhhhh ! that' s , that' s a poor ladies scream . - ahhhhh !!!
- it' s a little better . is there some kind of nerdy super villain website , where you get tesla coils , and blinky dials ? actually most of it comes from an outlet store in ... don' t answer that . ( whispers ) ... romania . don' t ! stop ! she' s using her nosey reporter skills , on your weak willed mind to find out all our secrets . ( gasps in fear ) such tricks ... won' t work ... on me .
- please talk slower - temptress . what secrets ? you' re so predictable . predictable , predictable ? oh , you call thls predictable ? your alligators , yes . i was thinking about it on the way over . what' s this ? boom ! - in your face .
- cliché . no , look , watch . juvenile . - shuck it all ! - tacky - oh , so sorry . - seen it . - what' s this one do ? - garish . roxanne :
okay , the spiders new . spider ? ee , uh , yes ! the " spee .. ider " . even the smallest bite from arachnis deathicus will instantly paralyze ... ow ! get it off ! megamind : ow ! - give it up , megamind .
your plans never work . let' s stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights , shall we ? ooowww ! it is with great pleasure that i present to metro man , this new museum . if you please . uh , hey , my kid can' t see . - megamind . - oh , bravo metro man . yes , i can play along too . booooo .
should have known you' d try to crash the party . oh , i intend to do more than crash it . this is the day you and montrosity , shall not soon forget . it' s pronounced metro city ! oh , potato , tomato , potato , tomato . we all know how this ends . with you behind bars . oh , i' m shaking in my custom baby seal- leather boots . you will leave , montrosity . megamind :
or this will be the last you ever hear of , roxanne ritchi ! - roxanne ! - don' t panic roxie , i' m on my way . - i' m not panicking . in order to stop me , you need to find me first , metro man . we' re at the abandoned observatory . - ah ha . - no ! no we' re not !
megamind : don' t listen to her , she' s crazy . metro man approaching , sir . - hah ! hold on a second . megamind : oh , good heavens . you didn' t think you were in the real observatory , did you ? ready the death ray , minion . death ray , readying .
megamind : over here , old friend . megamind : in case you haven' t noticed , you' ve fallen right into my trap . you can' t trap justice . it' s an idea , a belief . even the most heartfelt belief , can be corroded over time . justice is a noncorrosive metal . but metals can be melted by the heat of ' re- vange ' .
it' s ' revenge ' and it' s best served cold . but it can be easily reheated , in the microwave of evil . well i think your warranty is about to expire . maybe i got an extended warranty ? warranties are invalid if you don' t use the product for its intended purpose . oh , girls , girls , you' re both pretty . can i go home now ? of course , that is if metro man , can withstand the full concentrated power of the ... sun ! flre ! minion , fire ...
uh , it' s still warming up , sir . - come again ? - warming up , sir . warming up ? the sun is warming up ? one ... sssecond ... more . aaannnd .... jussst . minion : tippy , tappy tippy tap , tap , tip top more . - honestly . - and we are ready , in just .
oh ! i told you to have things ready . i told you countless times . why do you always blame me ? my spider bite is acting . your plan is failing , just admit it . yeah , good luck with that one . whose side are you on ? the losing side . - thank you .
- uh , could someone stamp my frequent kidnapping card ? you of all people , know we discontinued that promotion . - chow , chow all . - same time next week ? what did he just say ? crab nuggets ? good lord , i' m trapped . what kind of trickery is this ? you mad genius . your dark gift has finally paid off .
it , it has ? this dome is obviously lined with copper . - yeah , so ? - minion : sir ! metro man : copper drains my powers . your weakness is copper ? you' re kidding , right ? ( coughs ) i don' t think even he could survive that .
well , lets not get our hopes up just yet . - look ! - metro man . ( gasps ) metro man ... metro man ! ahhh ! you did it , sir . i did it ? he did it . megamind :
i did it . he did it . - you did it , sir . - i did it ! - you did it . - i did it ! montrocity is mine ! you did it sir , you did it , sir . yes you did . minion :
all right people , hit it . ( minion and megamind complimenting each other ) hit it ! * - ain' t got nothing i' d rather do . * megamind : first off , what a turnout . how wild is this , huh ? all i did was eliminate the most powerful man in the universe . megamind : are there any questions ? megamind :
come on .. yes ? you in the back . i' m sure we' d all like to know what you plan to do with us . and the city . good , i' m glad you asked that one . imagine , the most horrible , terrifying evil thing you could possibly think of . and multiply it by ... slx ! megamind : in the mean time i want you to carry on , with the dreary normal things you , normal people do .
let' s just have fun with this , come on . and i will get back to you . megamind : now slam the door , really hard . ( minion giggles ) megamind : they can ... they can still see you . minion : now ? yeah , you' re still there . minion :
oh , megamind : ( singing in miss america melody ) there he is , mr. evil overlord . ahh , minion . did you think this day would ever come ? no way , not at all , sir . never , never in a million , i mean ... yes , i did . look at the intricate moon links . i' m looking , i' m looking . and what' s this ?
looks like one of the giant monitors , in the lair . but it seems to only carry one station . oh , that sir is called a window . - window ... - all the kids are looking through them . oooo , i' ve never had a view before . montrosity minion , it' s all mine . if my parents could see me now . sir , i' m sure they' re smiling down from evil heaven . well now that mr. goody- two- shoes is out of the way .
i can have , everything i want ! and there' s no one to stop me . * looking forward to , but who wouldn' t do , the role i was about ... * megamind : i know , i know . always thirsty , never satisfied . megamind : i understand you , little well dressed bird . purposeless , emptiness , it' s a vacuum isn' t it . what' s your vacuum like ?
hey , hey , hey ! not now , minion . i' m in a heated existential discussion with this dead- eyed plastic desk toy . i ... is something wrong , sir ? just think about it . we have it all . but we have nothing . it' s just to easy now . i' m sorry , you' ve lost me , sir . - i mean , we did it , right ?
- well , you did it , sir . yes you' ve made that perfectly clear . - then why do i feel so , mel- on- cholly ? - huh ? unhappy . oh , uh well , uh . what if tomorrow , we could go kidnap roxanne ritchi . that always seems to lift your spirits . good idea , minion . but without him , what' s the point ?
- minion : him , sir ? - nothing . okay , um , all right well just uh , that’ s uh , something to consider and um , well , i think i' il just power down for a while then . roxanne : he was always there for us . roxanne : dependable . perhaps we took him for granted . maybe we never really know how good we have it , until it' s gone .
we miss you , metro man . i , miss you . roxanne : and i have just one question for , megamind . are you happy now ? this is roxanne ritchi reporting from a city without a hero . roxanne : coming up next . are you ready to be a slave army ? what you need to know .
aaannd wrap that up and give it to a child on christmas . - ' cause we' re done . - okay , see you tomorrow , hal . wait , roxie . i' m having a party at my house . coming off the hook , or whatever . you should come over . i got a dj rented a bouncy house . made a gallon of dip . it' s gonna be sick .
oh , i don' t know , hal . i don' t really fell like being around a bunch of people . that' s the best part , it' il be like just you and me . wow , that uh , that' s certainly very tempting . - but , - i did hire a wedding photographer . that' s just in case , we were like something crazy happened . and you' d want a picture of it . like maybe we should have this for like ever , um , i' m gonna pass . i have some work here i need to do .
okay , bye . so thursday ? soft , thursday ? - goodnight , hal . - it' s a soft yes , on thursday . what' s , wrong with me ? rented a bouncy house ? chick' s don' t like bouncy houses , they like clown' s . ow ! hal :
stupid van ! broke my finger ! i' ve made a horrible mistake . i didn' t mean to destroy you . i mean , i meant to destroy you . i didn' t think it would really work . what are we suppose to do ? without you , evil is running rampant through the streets . i am so tired of running rampant through the streets . what' s the point of being bad when there' s no good to try and stop you ?
someone has to stop , megamind . bernard : hey , we' re closing soon . oh , you scared me . - barry , right ? - bernard . bernard , i was just well i was talking to myself . you may think i' m a little bit nuts . i' m not allowed to self guess directly . thank you , i just ...
bernard , i' il just be another minute . - okay . - thanks . i had so many evil plans in the works . the illiteracy beam . typhoon cheese . robo sheep . battles we will now , never have . ( " never have " echoes ) you know we never had the chance to say goodbye .
so , it' s good that we have this time now . you know , before i destroy the place . nothing personal , it just brings back to many painful memories . hello , hello ? roxanne ! that' s a pretty tasteless costume . - costume ? - megamind' s head is not that grossly exaggerated . oh you even made a cheap replica of his dehydration gun . how ...
hello , is someone there ? hello , who' s there ? whoa ! it' s just you , bernard . oh , yes it' s just me . bernard . well thank you for letting me stay . look i wouldn' t stay for more than two minutes and thirty seven seconds if i were you . ( bangs button ) we' re having the walls and ceiling removed .
wow , that sounds like . quite the renovation . guess i' il ride down with you then . i kept thinking he was going to do one of his last minute escapes . yeah , he was really good at those . oh , if only the world had a reset button . i' ve looked into the reset button . the size is impossible . oh , bernard , i didn' t know you had ... feelings . are you okay ?
metro man is gone . and now there' s no one left to challenge megamind . roxanne : oh , come on , bernard . as long as there' s evil good will rise up against it . ohhh , i wish . i believe someone is going to stand up to megamind . - you really think so ? - yeah . i mean , it' s like they say .
heroes aren' t born , they' re made . heroes can be made . that' s it ! - all you need are the right ingredients . - yeah . - bravery . - yes . - strength . - of course . - determination .
- imperative . and a smidgen of dna . - with that , anyone can be a hero . - yeah ! oh , ho , ho , ho ! i think we should run . bye . time to put the past behind us . only the future ... ahh ! oh , i' m to close .
i' m genuinely scared right now . oh , i hope no ones seeing this . create a hero ? wait , wait , what ? why would you do that ? so i have someone to fight . minion , i' m a villain without a hero . a ying , with no yang . a bull fighter with no bull to fight . in other words , i have no purpose .
now , ask me how i' m going to do it . go on , ask . how are you doing to do it ? i' m going to give someone , i don' t know who yet . metro man' s powers . i' m going to train that someone to become montrocity' s new hero . over here , follow . and then , finally i' m going to fight that hero . in an epic battle of good and evil . we could put everything back the way it was .
when the world was perfect . and rosy . behold , minion . metro man' s cape . look closely . tell me what you see ? dandruff ? yes , it' s his dna . from this , we' il extract the source of metro man' s awesome power . minion :
sir , i think this is a bad idea . yes , it' s a very wickedly bad idea . for the greater good of man . but i' m saying this is a kind of bad , bad . okay , you might think it' s good in your bad perception . oh , you don' t know what' s good for bad . now we have just one shot at this . we must find a suitable subject . someone who will do harm to mine . who puts the welfare of others above their own .
what on earth is that ? seems to be emanating from there , sir . - o- ilo , - uh , it' s hello . hello , like that ? - bernard , it' s roxanne . - it' s roxanne . roxanne : i just want to thank you for inspiring me the other day . - oh , you' ve inspired me too . - great !
roxanne : it' s time we stood up to megamind and show him he can' t push us around . oh , oh really . she' s so cute . - i' m already hot on his trail . - uh , huh . and what gives you that idea ? - uh , sir . - i just found his secret hideout . how did she find my hideout ?
uh , how did you find his hideout ? this is the only building in metro city with a big observatory on the roof . okay , there' s no way she' il find the secret entrance . oh ! there' s a doormat here that say' s ' secret entrance ' . - minion ! - i kept forgetting where it was . she' il discover all our secrets . - ohh , oh no ! - you dim- witted creation of science .
- roxanne : what ? - oh , not you roxanne . no , i was just yelling at my mothers , urn . don' t do anything , i' il be right there . hal : roxanne ? oh no , not again . mega- bernard : roxanne .
- whoa ! - oh , i' m glad you' re here . wait , how did you get here so fast ? well , i uh . i happened to be speed walking nearby when you called . - in a suit ? - uh huh . it' s called , ' formal speed walking ' . but that' s not important . i better take the lead .
this way looks exciting . no , it says , exit . uh , which is the abbreviation for ' exciting ' , right ? roxanne : it' s the mother load . - wow . - wow . - just look at this thing . you know , i really could use your help in deciphering all this . - really ?
- you' re an expert in all things megamind , right ? - yes , right . - together we could figure out his plan for the city and stop it . are you in ? - oh , what fun ! - that' s what i want to hear . ( whispers ) minion , code- send in the brain bots . you know the whole point of a code is ... oh code- just do it , minion . ahh , it' s me you fools !
bernard ! it' s daddy . megamind ! what have you done with , bernard ? oh bernard ? oh yes , i' m doing horrible things to that man . i don' t want to get into it but , lasers , spikes . oh , please no , not the lasers and the spikes ! you know the drill . oh no , not the drill .
- let him go . - or what ? or i' m going to find out what this weird looking gun does . no don' t ! don' t shoot that gun . i' il just go get him . unhand me you fiend ! it , its strength' s to much . oh , i work out . argh , it' s really paying off .
you' re so fit , and strangely charismatic . are you okay ? i' ve did my best . but he' s to fantastic . here , let me carry that heavy gun for you . i got this covered . let go , it' s mine ! bernard , run ! give it to me . oh no !
roxanne . who on earth is that ? roxanne ! bernard , you were right about that door being exciting . this way . - what are you doing ? this will stop them , here ! seems a bit extreme , doesn' t it . just throw it . daddy' s , sorry .
- wow , that was real exciting . - yeah . - you were very strong in there . i' ve never seen anyone but metro man stand up to him like that . what' s going on ? hal , what happened ? i think a bee flew up my nose . i was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you , but like fifty ninjas started to attack me . so i had to beat them all up , and i did ... - and they were all like crying , and stuff .
- wow . brave one , isn' t he . who are you ? oh thi ... , this is bernard . - he' s my partner . - partner ? yes , yes partner . well look partner , i' m her partner . she doesn' t know what she' s saying . she' s been through a traumatic experience .
i' d better take him home . thanks again , bernard . i' il call you tomorrow , partner . yeah , okay . i' d like that . that was weird for everybody . ' cause you accidentally , hugged him instead of me . minion : sir ! minion :
minion whispers : code- did you find out who it was ? code- get the car . code- right away , sir . - bye . - see you tomorrow , hal . i' il leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later . megamind : who is this man , we' ve infused with godlike power ? ow , ow , whoa ho .
well sir , his name' s hal stewart . he' s twenty eight years old . no criminal record . actually , no records at all . apparently , this man hasn' t accomplished anything . not yet , minion . not ... ... yet . could this day get anymore , funtastic ? so i will just go ahead and defuse him , since this is clearly a mistake . something much more powerful at work .
this is no mistake . it' s destiny . hal stewart , prepare for your destiny . hal ? hal stewart ? am i saying it right ? - stewart . is this a robbery ? ' cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me . oh , look .
it' s hal stewart . quick , the spray . - oops , all out . - well use the forget- me- stick . oh , right ! just look at him . well , he doesn' t look quite the hero type to me . oh , you' re such a pill , minion . the power couldn' t ask for a finer claim . i smell hero .
i smell something burning . i think it' s working ! places , places , places , places ... you have your disguise ? what ? ah , you look fantastic . rise , my glorious creation . rise , and come to papa . what' s going on ? - easy my child .
- who are you ? i sent you to this planet to teach you about justice . megamind : honor , and nobility . i am your father . so you' re like , my space dad ? yeah , i' m like your space dad . and you are , what ? i' m your space , step- mom . i , i had some work done recently .
is this some kind of dream ? this is a dream come true . you' ve been blethed with unfathomamble power . what kind of power ? unfathamomble . it' s un , without fathom . - whoa - yeah , we' ve come to guide you . on your path to be montrosity' s new hero . and battle the super genius , of megamind . i know this is a lot to take in .
it may take months for you to come to grips .. no frickin ' way . i wasn' t finished . i' m going to be a hero . i' m going to be a hero . thee minion , he' s perfect . * ( e. l. o. ' s mr. blue sky ) * aaannd , action ! minion : someone help me .
- i' m okay . zap , zap , zap . the flames of my evil burn bright . now you thay thomething cool back at me . look , it doesn' t even hurt . don' t even feel it . no , no , no . slow it down , and stop . i said slow down . watch out .
he' s hopeless . hopeless ! - maybe we should change tactics ? - you think so ? oh , you know how boys are . they love video games . i can throw a few parts together . can' t ... wait . lol , smiley face . can' t wait for what , sir ?
oh , that was such a funny story . and brilliantly told , by the way . okay , now you tell one . bernard , i never knew you were so funny . and , i never heard you laugh before . yeah , it' s been a while . feels pretty good . and , exit . * i' il remember you this way . * you don' t get out much , do you ?
fun ! i used to come here with my mother when i was a kid . it was one of my favorite things to do . now look at it . it' s a dump . why are we cleaning up the city , sir ? um , well we don' t want to battle our new hero in a dump , now ... do we ? they' re all back . but how , why ? maybe megamind isn' t so bad after all .
that' s it . be free , my beautiful dove . okay , okay , metro man and i , were never a couple . but i thought you two were ... i know , everybody did . it' s just , well he was never really my type . really ? okay , now you tell me something . something you' ve never told anyone . well , in shh- school .
none of the other kids really liked me . i was always last one picked for everything . hmm , it' s to bad that we didn' t go to the same school . hal , i think you' re ready for this . do i have a son ? no , hal , you make me laugh . it stretches , it' s for you . hey , what' s the ' t ' stand for ? titan . tighten ?
what' s that suppose to mean ? it was the only name i could trademark . oh . do you have someone special in your life , hal ? no not yet , but . there' s this really , really good looking one i' ve got my eye on , currently . that' s very good . romance is very inspiring . - that' s what i hear . - all you have to do , is save her .
mega- space dad : and she' il be yours . - who want' s churro' s ? - i do ! hal : thanks spaced out , momma . mega- space dad : on the count of three , unsheathe your churro . all together : one , two , three !
to titan . mega- space dad : tomorrow , you will fight megamind . mega- space dad : and the city will know your name . the city' s parks ' restored to their original glory . the street' s , the safest they' ve been . the banks reopened . has something happened to megamind ? has someone tamed this monster ?
this is roxanne ritchi cautiously optimistic , and pleasantly confused . well you seem in a very good mood tonight , sir . huh ? oh yes , how long is this going to take ? just a few alterations , sir . and i will be done with your most terrifying cape yet . i' m calling it , the black mambaaaaaaa ... aaaa ... aaa . black mamba , perfect . ooo , gosh i am running late . i have to go .
what , where , where are you going , sir ? we have our debut battle with titan tomorrow morning . we haven' t even tested your big battle suit yet . you attend to the details , minion . i have to , run a quick errand . you don' t run errands . what' s going on here ? - what ? - oh , wait a minute . are you wearing jean- paul gaultier' s , for him ?
it' s just my natural musk . now , where are the car keys ? ahhh . this is about ms. ritchi , isn' t it . your going on a date with her . no my main man , get out of town . oh this is bad , this is bad . you' ve fallen in love with her . you are forgetting your place , minion . now give me the keys .
what happens when roxanne finds out who you really are ? she will never find out . that' s the point of lying . ahhh ! honestly , if i didn' t know any better i' d think this was your first day of being evil . no ! this has gone far enough . oh , that was really grown up . sir please , it' s for your own good . well what do you know .
i may not know much , but i do know this . the bad guy doesn' t get the girl . maybe i don' t want to be the bad guy anymore . you heard me . ( whispers in fear ) who are you ? - now give me the keys . - no ! my soul purpose in life is to look after you . well i don' t need you to look after me . what are you ... what are you saying ?
- you don' t need me ? - let me make it clear . code- i don' t need you . you know what , you know what . code- i' il just pack my thing and go . code- fine ! code- fine back . well good luck on your date . - i will . - that doesn' t even make any sense .
i know . i know i am so close , i can feel it . okay , okay i just have to take a step back . wait a minute . roxanne : titan . what' s a titan ? my super ears are burning . i usually just hear criminals . you haven' t been naughty , have you ?
i' m totally messing with you . i' m totally messing with you . the names titan . - titan ? - your very own heroic guardian of pure awesome . what' s your name ? just kidding , i know everything about you . oh , oh ! and i brought some flowers , didn' t know what you liked , so i just grabbed you know , all of them .
okay , you don' t like flowers . okay , uh , uh , forget the flowers . - what do you want ? - thought maybe we could go for a little flight around town . - get to know each other first . - whoa ! it' s suppose to be very thrilling for you . just what do you think you' re doing ? oh are i moving to fast ? you' re probably right .
i should just rescue you a few times before we get all romantic . saved you . you are lucky to have such a great hero here . somebody do something ? oh , right , right . duh ! i gotcha . that was fun , you almost died . but i saved you . - aaaah , building !
gotcha ! whoo , i' m sorry . what were you saying ? i couldn' t hear you over the sound of me saving your life . put me down , right now ! okay , all right , all right , hold on . are you crazy ? i suppose i' m , a little crazy ... about you . who are you ? really .
oooh , oooh , right . well prepare to have your mind blown , little lady . - hal ? yeah , isn' t this great ? now there' s nothing keeping us apart . no , it' s not great . wow , our first fight . this is so us , we' re like an old married couple . there is no us , okay . there will never be an us .
but , i have powers . i have a cape , i' m the good guy . you are a good guy , hal . but you don' t understand we need to find out why ... - right now , - this isn' t right . - listen to me , hal . - you' re suppose to be with me . i' m trying to warn you , hal . it' s tighten . it' s tlghten , not hal .
- bernard . - roxanne . - sorry i' m late . - wow , your hair looks exciting . hmm , not the only exciting development of the night . megamind' s created a new hero . and i know why . it all makes sense now . he missed getting his butt kicked , so he created a new hero to kick it for him . but why did he pick , hal ?
hal is the worst possible person you could pick . wow , that' s a lot to take in . it , it boggles my mind . i am extremely boggled . you know , i' m sure we' il get to the bottom of who' s kicking who' s butt . but in the mean time . let' s enjoy each other' s company . i' m sorry , bernard . of course , your right , you know , i could use a breather . to , bernard .
for being the only normal thing in my crazy upside down world . to ... being normal . - roxanne . - yes ? say i wasn' t so normal . say i was bald and had the complexion of a popular primary color . as a random , non specific example . would you still enjoy my company ? of course , you don' t judge a book by its cover . oh , that' s a relief to hear .
you judge them based on their actions . well that seems kinda petty , don' t you think . - what , what ? oh , don' t look at me ! just , just a technical glitch . don' t look yet . my bad . where were we ? now , now , hold on . you !
i can explain . ( growls in anger ) what about everything you just said ? about judging a book by it' s cover . well let' s take a look at the contents then , shall we ? you destroyed metro man . you took over the city and then you actually got me to care about you . why are you so evil ? tricking me ? what could you possibly hope to gain ?
wait a minute . oh , i don' t believe this . do you really think that i would ever be with you ? ( softly whispers ) no ... okay minion , you were right . i was .... less right . we should stick to what we' re good at . being bad . minion ... you there .
yeah , you . bring out , the ' black mamba ' ! okay , titan it' s time to go down , in style . i hear there' s a new hero . who dares to challenge my evil . where is the one they call , titan ? challenge me , if you dare . ( making car motor sounds ) megamind playfully cries : oh no , we' re gonna crash . this is embarrassing .
ballsy and incipient . boneheaded , irresponsible . rude ! unprofessional , that' s what this is . would metro man have kept me waiting ? of course not , he was a pro . hey , megamind . you' re actually the guy i want to see . also , there' s a door here . do you have any idea how long i waited for you ?
no , no , no , i totally understand what you' re saying . could you just shut up for one second , i' m trying to beat this level . were you even planning on showing up ? what' s this ? where did you get all this stuff ? ( whispers ) it doesn' t belong to me . you stole it ! - pretty cool , right . - oh no , no , no . you' re a hero .
being a hero is for losers . it' s work , work , work twenty four seven , and for what ? i only took the gig to get the girl . and it turns out roxanne doesn' t want anything to do with me . roxanne ritchi ? yeah , roxanne ritchi . i saw her having dinner , and making googly eyes at some intellectual dweeb . - ohhhh - who needs all that noise . that' s why i think , we should team up . you ?
wait ! what ? with my power , and your big headedness , we could rule the city . - you want to team up ? - i even drew up some new costume designs . - see - costume design ? you be the brain so you get a little brain wearing glasses on your costume , or something . and since i' m the cool one , i' il have like two tanks sword fighting . i can' t believe you . all your gifts all your powers , and you squander them for your own personal gain .
- yes ! - no ! i ' m the villain , you' re the good guy . i do something bad , and you come and get me . that' s why i created you . yeah , right . you' re nuts . - space dad told me . - look , i' m your space dad . you should be more like metro man .
you tricked me ? oh , don' t like that , huh ? well there' s more . i' m also the intellectual dweeb dating roxanne . - no . - and we were smooching up a storm . mmmore ... mmmore ... mmmore . when i get my hands on you i' m gonna , ... yes ! yes i know .
bring me to justice . oh god , how i missed this . and the hero strikes the first blow . but evil returns with a backhand . yes ! come out you little freak ! i want to see what that big brain looks like on the pavement . you fell for the oldest evil trick in the book . you little blue , twerp . en garde !
oh , now that' s the spirit . take , that , parry again ! now it' s time for some witty back and forth banter . you go first . look , i' m not sure where to go with that . this one' s for stealing my girlfriend . this one' s for space dad making a fool out of me . and megamind ! this one' s for space , step- mom . you lied to her !
oh , well done , i thought that pummeling went really , really well . i mean , i have a few notes . - notes ? - but they can wait . you can take me to jail now . oh , no , no , no . i was thinking more like the morgue . - you' re dead ! - whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . this isn' t how you play the game .
game over . brain bots . i' m calling time out . time out , time out ! brain bots . initiate the fail safe . guess what , buster brown ? it' s made from copper . you' re powerless against it . it' s a very safe metal used to defeat ...
metro man ? you , should stop comparing me to metro man . tighten : you can run megamind , but you can' t hide . mayor : we' re saved , we' re saved ! what' s your name , new hero ? - it' s tighten . - thank you , thank you . tighten has freed us .
oh i wouldn' t say free . tighten : more like , under new management . what do you want ? - titan' s turned evil . - congratulations , another one of your genius plans has backfired on you . and why did my doorman let you up ? - carlos ? - what are you , no , no ! i need your help .
why do you need my help ? because you' re the smartest person i know . well you can' t hide here . copper should have worked , why didn' t the copper work ? the copper worked perfectly well the last time . copper ? you' re not making any sense . look , if we don' t find titan' s weakness . he' il destroy the whole city . okay , how can i help ?
we need to find answers . you knew metro man best . did he have a hideout , a cave , a solitary fortress of some kind ? anything that would give us clues . well , there is one place i know . you gave him these powers , can' t you just take them away ? i can' t , i lost my diffuser gun when i misplaced the invisible car . the night you dumped me . alone . in the rain .
- did you ever look back ? - no ! - oh , my giant blue head . - i guess we' re here . so , this is where he hid it . after all these years . my old shhool house . you know , i think there' s an apology in order , for the other night . okay that would be nice . but make it quick .
we have much more pressing matters to deal with . wow , can' t believe he kept all this stuff . aww , i remember when he wore that . can we try to stay focused here ? yes of course , you' re right , focused . come over and look at this . what is it ? what did you find ? um ..... look ! this glass has ice cubes in it .
yes , that' s what happens when water gets cold . no , what i' m saying is , don' t you think it' s a little odd that the ice hasn' t melted yet ? one of life' s great mysteries . hey . aaaaaaaah ! tv news anchor : we now have a confirmed report . tighten , first thought to be the city' s new hero , has turned evil . the city has never seen this level of destruction . if only metro man were still alive .
- you' re alive ? - you' re alive . i' m alive . roxanne : but .. we .. we saw your skeleton . - you were dead . - are you a ghost ? there had better be , an amazing explanation for this . speak , apparition . okay , okay , okay , okay .
you both deserve the truth . it all started back at the observatory . roxanne was kidnapped , i was gonna stop you . my head wasn' t in the game that day . we were kinda going through the motions . so ... using my super speed . i decided to go clear my head . then i realized we had done this same silly charade our entire lives . i tried to get my mind off how i was feeling .
but i just felt stuck . i began to realize , despite all my powers , each and every citizen of metro had something i didn' t . a choice . ever since i can remember i' ve always had to be what the city wanted me to be . but what about what i wanted to do ? then it suddenly hit me . i do have a choice . i can be whatever i want to be . no one said this hero thing had to be a life time gig . you can' t just quit either .
that' s when i got the brilliant idea ... ... to fake my death . copper drains my powers ! - you' re weakness is copper ? - ( laughs ) once your death ray hit . i never felt so alive . so i borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school . metro man was finally dead . and music man was born . music man ?
that way i can keep my logo . - what ? - ' cause of what ? finally i' m free , to get in touch with my true power . weaving lyrical magic . check this out . * i have eyes that can see * * right through leaaadd . * - that' s horrible . - granted you have talent ,
but there' s a mad man out there destroying our ... your city . ( metal clangs on face ) how could you do this ? the people of the city relied on you , and you deserted them . you left us in the hands of , him ! no offense . no , i' m with you . look , we need your help . i' m sorry , i really am . um , i' m , i' m done . you know , little buddy .
there' s a ying for every yang . metro man : if there' s bad , good will rise up against it . metro man : it' s taken me a long time to find my calling . now it' s about time , you find yours . roxanne : hey , who needs him . roxanne : we can beat tighten ourselves .
i say we go back to the evil lair . grab some ray guns , hold them sideways , and just go all gangsta on ' em . we can' t so that' s it ? you' re just giving up ? i' m the bad guy . i don' t save the day . i don' t fly off into the sunset , and i don' t get the girl . i' m going home . tv reporter :
unless someone comes to our aid soon , all may be lost . thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus . remaining citizens are warned , to stay indoors until further notice . authorities have issued a warning , to stay out of the downtown area at all costs . hal ! hal ! let me guess , after seeing how awesome i am , you' ve finally come to your senses . well , i' m over you . i' ve come to stop you , hal . you ?
oh , well . okay , what are you going to do , report me to death ? i was going to try reasoning with you . you and i , we worked together for a long time . i know you . you don' t know me . you never took the time to know me . this is the first time we' ve hung out socially . and it' s when i' m about to destroy the city . i want to talk to the real hal .
i want to talk to the guy who loved being a camera man , and eating dip , and being a nerd and being not as scary as the tighten- hal . to late ! megamind . you and i have some unfinished business . i' il be waiting at metro tower , oh , and just so you don' t get cold feet . roxanne ! come on roxi , call for your hero to come rescue you . megamind . i don' t even know if you' re listening , but if you are ...
you can' t give up . the megamind i knew would never have run from a fight . even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning . it was your best quality . you need to be that guy , right now . the city needs you . i need you . roxanne . you have one hour . don' t ... keep me waiting .
warden , warden ! listen to me , you have to let me go . tighten has to be stopped . sorry megamind , you still have 88 life sentences to go . plenty of time to reflect on what you' ve done . if you want to hear me say it ? i' il say it . here it is . from the blackest part of my heart . i .... am .... sorry !
not buying it . i don' t blame you . megamind : i' ve terrorized the city countless times . created a hero who' s turned out to be a villain . i lied to roxanne . my best friend , minion . i treated like dirt . please , don' t make this city , don' t make roxanne pay for my wrong doings . apology accepted .
uh , minion . you fantastic fish , you . what are we waiting for ? we' d better get going . you got me ! good luck , fellows . megamind : we' re gonna die ! minion : wait , what ?
hey , metro losers . this is metro tower . tighten : they say it' s suppose to be a symbol of our cities strength . but , for me , it' s a reminder of the day this woman ferociously ripped out my heart . and i hate reminders . hal ! please don' t do this . i know there' s still good in you , hal . you' re so naive , roxie .
you see the good in everybody , even when it' s not there . you' re living a fantasy . there is no easter bunny . there is no tooth fairy . and there is no queen of england . this is the real world . and you need to wake up . you dare challenge megamind ? this town isn' t big enough for two super villains . megamind :
oh , you' re a villain all right . just not a super one . yeah , what' s the difference ? presentatlon ! i knew you' d come back . well , that makes one of us . - what' s the plan ? - well , mostly involves , not dying . i , like that plan . i can' t control it .
no ! well , that was easy . looks like there' s only one loose end now . please , let' s have a little respect for public transportation . you came back . you were right , roxanne . i never should have left . whoa , i ... i thought you were dead . my death was , greatly exaggerated . so , you' re the punk i' ve heard about .
i' m sorry , i did the best i could . i' m so proud of you . minion ? surprise ! heh , heh , heh . he' s the real hero . megamind . going somewhere ? besides jail . no , not in the face man , please .
if you know what' s good for you , tighten . you' il stay out of montrosity . - you got it ! - for good . pretty sneaky , sis . but there is only one person i know who calls this town , montrosity . ooops . you ! bet you think it' s really funny , huh ? let' s all laugh at the really cool guy , huh .
you' re not going to be laughing for long . the invisible car . hey , remember that night that i dumped you ? you are bringing this up now ? i did look back . you did ? you dld ! yes , and you should look back , right now . oh , i get it . this is the last time you' il make a fool out of me .
i made you a hero . you did the fool thing , all by yourself . you' re so pathetic . no matter what side you' re on . you' re always the looser . there' s a benefit to loosing . you get to learn from your mistakes . oh , you' ve got to be kidding me ! minion , if i live , i will kill you . enjoy your flight .
megamind . megamind narrates : so , this is how it ends . normally i' d chalk this up to my last glorious failure . but not today ! what can i say ? old habits die hard . say bye , bye roxie . ollo . thing about bad guys , they always loose !
we did it , you won . well , i finally had a reason to win . you . mlnion ! can' t see it' s cold and ... warm , and dark and light . it' s me , minion . i' m right here . we' ve had a lot of adventures together . you and i. we have , minion .
i mean ... most of them ended in horrible failure , but , we won today . didn' t we , sir ? yes minion , we did it . thanks to you . code- we' re the good guys now . code- i guess we are . i' m going ... i think this ... this is it , i mean i' m going far awa ... ( gasps ) oh , what a drama queen .
you know , i' m feeling much better now . i guess i just needed a swim - he had you , didn' t he . - whew ! classic , minion . don' t give them the face . megamind : there he is with that little face . look at that face . we did it !
we did it ! - fist pump ! - you did it ! we won , we won , we won . what ! get back you savages ! sorry , sorry . he' s just not used to positive feedback . funny , i guess destiny is not the path given to us . but the path we choose for ourselves .
all right , put your hands in the air . now hand over your wallets . i' m just kidding . just kidding . i have to admit . being good , has its perks . you know , you look pretty good in white . megamind , if you please . uh , hey , my kid can' t see . sorry my friend .
way to go , little buddy . i knew you had it in you . mayor : ladies and gentlemen ... megamlnd ! defender of metro city . you know , i like the sound of that . hit it ! * you know i' m bad , i' m bad - come on . * * you know i' m bad , i' m bad - you know it . * - hal :
* who' s bad ! * here' s my day so far : went to jail , lost the girl of my dreams , and got my butt kicked pretty good . still , things could be a lot worse . oh , that' s right . i' m falling to my death . guess they can' t . how' d it all come to this , you ask ? my end starts at the beginning . the very beginning . yes , that' s me .
i had a fairly standard childhood . i came from , what you might call , a broken home . literally broken . i was eight days old and still living with my parents . how sad is that ? clearly it was time to move on . here is your minion . he will take care of you . and here is your binky . you are destined for ...
i didn' t quite hear that last part , but it sounded important . - ... two , one . - destined for what ? i set out to find my destiny . turns out a kid from the glaupunkt quadrant had the exact same idea . that was the day i met mr. goody two- shoes ... ... and our glorious rivalry was born . could this be what i was destined for ? a dream life filled with luxury . apparently not . even fate picks its favorites . no big deal .
a much different fate awaited me . a baby ! how thoughtful . oh , yes . yes , i saw it and thought of you . luckily i found a lovely little place to call home . can we keep it ? a place that taught me the differences between right ... ... and wrong . mr. goody two- shoes , on the other hand , had life handed to him on a silver platter . our baby can fly .
yes , yes , nothing but the best for you , darling . the power of flight , invulnerability , and great hair . but i had something far , far greater . my amazing intellect ... ... and knack for building objects of mayhem . after a few years , and with some time off for good behavior , i was given an opportunity to better myself through learning ... ... at a strange place called shool . it was there that i once again ran into mr. goody two- shoes . he had already amassed a gigantic army of soft- headed groupies . he bought their affections with showmanship and extravagant gifts of deliciousness . so i , too , will make this popp- ed corn and win over those mindless drones .
lights out . that' s when i learned a very hard lesson : good receives all the praise and adulation , while evil is sent to quiet- time in the corner . so fitting in wasn' t really an option . while they were learning the itsy bitsy spider ... ... i learned how to dehydrate animate objects and rehydrate them at will . some days , it felt like it was just me and minion against the world . no matter how hard i tried , i was always the odd man out , the last one picked , the screw- up , the black sheep ... get him ! - ... the bad boy . - freak !
was this my destiny ? wait , maybe it was . being bad is the one thing i' m good at . then it hit me : if i was the bad boy , then i was going to be the baddest boy of them all . i was destined to be a super- villain , and we were destined to be rivals . the die had been cast , and so began an enduring , epic , lifelong career . and i loved it . our battles quickly got more elaborate . he would win some .
i would almost win others . he took the name metro man , defender of metrocity . i decided to pick something a little more humble : megamind ... ... incredibly handsome criminal genius and master of all villainy . read on your own time . open up . oh , good morning , warden . great news : i' m a changed man , and ... ... and i' m ready to re- enter society as a solid citizen . you' re a villain , and you' il always be a villain .
you' il never change , and you' il never leave . you' re fun . you got a present in the mail . is it a puppy ? from metro man . " to count every second of your 85 life sentences . " that' s funny . never thought metro man was the gloating type . oh , but he does have nice taste . i think i' il keep it .
any chance you could give me the time ? i don' t want to be late for the opening of the metro man museum . oh no . looks like you' re gonna miss it , by several thousand years . oh , am i ? happy metro man day , metro city . it' s a beautiful day in beautiful downtown , where we' re here to honor a beautiful man , metro man . his heart is an ocean that' s inside a bigger ocean . for years he' s been watching us with his super- vision , saving us with his super- strength and caring for us with his super- heart . now it' s our turn to give something back .
this is roxanne ritchi , reporting live from the dedication of the metro man museum . ok , the stuff they make you read on- air , that' s un- freaking- believable . it' s crazy . i wrote that piece myself , hal . what i was trying to say was , i can' t believe that in our modern society , they let , like , actual art get onto the news . - nice save , hal . - what are we ... like , let' s just get a coffee or something . come on , it' s time to get in the metro man day spirit .
well , if i were metro man , megamind wouldn' t be kidnapping you all the time . - that' s the first thing . - that' s sweet , hal . and i' d be watching you , like a dingo watches a human baby . ok , that sounded ... - ok , that sounded a little weird . - a little bit . yeah . and you' re making a weird face , and that' s making me feel weird .
the point is , i would watch you like someone ... not love . we' re not in love . i' m not saying i love you . hey , i love you . whatever . but i' m not saying like i' m in love with you . i' m saying ... roxanne ? roxaroo ?
get back to work . the city doesn' t pay you to loaf . - freeze ! - whoa . what are you doing , guys ? it' s me ! it' s the warden . hey ! open up ! no , you fools .
he' s tricked us . you were right . i' il always be a villain . well , hello good- looking . need a lift ? certainly do , you fantastic fish , you . - get in the car , you . - i' m free ! right ? nice work sending me the watch , minion .
- you got it , boss . - punch it ! all right , put your hands in the air . ladies and gentlemen , your metro man ! - who' s your man ? yeah , metro city ! gimme some . come on . give it now . give it to me .
right on . gimme the good stuff . all right . hey , metro city . hey . hey . you know , you know , i just want to bring it down a bit . boys , a little lower . thank you , fellas . let' s get real for a moment .
that' s right . that' s right . that' s right . although getting a whole museum is super- cool , is super- cool , you want to know what the greatest honor you' ve given me is ? do you really want to know ? really ? i' il tell you . the greatest honor you' ve given me is letting me serve you , the helpless people of metro city . and at the end of every day , well , i often ask myself ... ... who would i be without you ? - i love you , metro man !
- and i love you , random citizen . i tell you , minion . there' s no place like evil lair . i' ve kept it cold and damp just for you , sir . how do i look , minion ? do i look bad ? disgustingly horrifying , sir . you always know what to say . oh , the brain- bots certainly missed you , sir . did you miss your daddy ?
who' s a menacing little cyborg ? you are . yes , you are . no biting . no , no , no , no , no , no . you want the wrench ? go get the wrench . - oh , look at that . - now , back to laughing . she' s awake .
quick , to work . miss ritchi , we meet again . would it kill you to wash the bag ? you can scream all you wish , miss ritchi . i' m afraid no one can hear you . why isn' t she screaming ? miss ritchi , if you don' t mind ? like this ... but that' s , that' s a poor lady scream . he' s a little better .
is there some kind of nerdy super- villain website where you get tesla coils and blinky dials ? actually , most of it comes from an outlet store in ... don' t answer that . - romania . - don' t ! stop ! she' s using her nosy reporter skills on your weak- willed mind to find out all our secrets . such tricks won' t work on me ... - please talk slower . - ... temptress . what secrets ?
you' re so predictable . predictable ? predictable ? oh , you call this predictable ? your alligators . yes . yeah , i was thinking about it on the way over . what' s this ? boom ! in your face .
- cliché . - no ! look , watch . - juvenile . - shock and awe . - tacky . - oh , it' s so scary ! - seen it . - what' s this one do ? garish .
- ok , the spider' s new . - spider ? yes . the ... the spee- ider . even the smallest bite from arachnis deathicus will instantly paralyze ... get it off ! it bit me ! give it up , megamind . your plans never work .
let' s stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights , shall we ? it is with great pleasure that i present to metro man his new museum . if you please . - hey ! my kid can' t see . - megamind ! - oh , bravo , metro man . boo ! yes , i can play along too . boo !
should' ve known you' d try to crash the party . oh , i intend to do more than crash it . this is a day you and metrocity shall not soon forget . it' s pronounced metro city ! potato- tomato , potato- tomato . we all know how this ends : with you behind bars . i' m shaking in my custom baby seal leather boots . you will leave metrocity , or this will be the last you ever hear of roxanne ritchi . roxanne ! don' t panic , roxie .
- i' m on my way . - yeah , i' m not panicking . in order to stop me , you need to find me first , metro man . we' re at the abandoned observatory . no , we' re not ! don' t listen to her . she' s crazy . metro man approaching , sir . hold on a second . oh , good heavens !
you didn' t think you were in the real observatory , did you ? ready the death ray , minion . death ray , readying . over here , old friend . in case you haven' t noticed , you' ve fallen right into my trap . you can' t trap justice . it' s an idea , a belief . even the most heartfelt belief can be corroded over time . justice is a non- corrosive metal . but metals can be melted by the heat of revange .
it' s " revenge , " and it' s best served cold . but it can be easily reheated in the microwave of evil . well , i think your warranty is about to expire . maybe i got an extended warranty . warranties are invalid if you don' t use the product for its intended purpose . oh , girls , girls , you' re both pretty . can i go home now ? of course . that is , if metro man can withstand the full , concentrated power of the sun ! fire !
minion . fire ? - it' s still warming up , sir . - come again ? - warming up , sir . - warming up ? the sun is warming up ? one second more and ... ... just tippy- tappy tippy- tap- tap , tip- top more , - and we are ready in just ... - honestly !
on my way , roxie . i told you to have things ready . i told you countless times . why do you always blame me ? my spider bite is acting up . your plan is failing . just admit it . yeah , good luck with that one . whose side are you on ? - the losing side .
- thank you . could someone stamp my frequent kidnapping card ? you of all people know we discontinued that promotion . - ciao- ciao , all ! - same time next week ? crab nuggets ! - what did he just say ? - " crab nuggets " ? - good lord , i' m trapped . - ten ...
- what kind of trickery is this ? - ... nine ... - you mad genius . - ... eight ... - your dark gift has finally paid off . - ... seven ... - it ... it has ? - ... six ... this dome is obviously lined with copper . - yeah ? so ? - sir ... - copper drains my powers . - ... two ...
- your weakness is copper ? - ... one . - you' re kidding , right ? - full power . i don' t think even he could survive that . well , let' s not get our hopes up just yet . - look ! - metro man ! metro man . metro man ! you did it , sir .
- i did it ? he did it . - i did it ? - he did it . - you did it , sir . - i did it ! - you did it ! - i did it ! metrocity is mine ! - you did it , sir !
- i did it ! yeah , me , me ! - yes , i did it ! - us ! we both did it ! - not us ! i ! - you , a little more - than me but still , come on ! - a lot more than you .
when they' re giving out the awards , - i' m gonna be right there next to you . - what awards ? hit it ! drop ' em ! first off , what a turnout . how wild is this ? all i did was eliminate the most powerful man in the universe . are there any questions ? go on .
yes ! you in the back . i' m sure we' d all like to know what you plan to do with us and this city . good , i' m glad you asked that . imagine the most horrible , terrifying , evil thing you can possibly think of , and multiply it ... by six ! in the meantime , i want you to carry on with the dreary , normal things you normal people do . let' s just have fun with this . come on . and i will get back to you .
now slam the door really hard . they ... they can still see you . - now ? - your elbow' s still in . there he is , mr. evil overlord oh , minion , did you think this day would ever come ? no way . not at all , sir . never .
never in a million ... i mean ... - yes , i did . - look at the intricate mouldings . i' m looking . i' m looking . and what' s this ? it' s like one of the giant monitors in the lair . but it seems to only carry one station . oh , that , sir , is called a window .
- window ? - all the kids are looking through them . i' ve never had a view before . metrocity , minion , it' s all mine . if my parents could see me now . sir , i' m sure they' re smiling down from evil heaven . and now that mr. goody two- shoes is out of the way , i can have everything i want , and there' s no one to stop me ! i know . i know .
always thirsty , never satisfied . i understand you , little well- dressed bird . purposeless , emptiness . it' s a vacuum , isn' t it ? it' s ... what' s your vacuum like ? hey , hey , hey , hey ! not now , minion . i' m in a heated , existential discussion with this dead- eyed , plastic desk toy . is something wrong , sir ?
just think about it . we have it all . yet , we have nothing . it' s just too easy now . i' m sorry , you' ve lost me , sir . i mean , we did it , right ? well , you did it , sir . yes , you' ve made that perfectly clear . then why do i feel so ... mel- on- choly . " mel- on- choly " ?
- unhappy . what if tomorrow , we could go kidnap roxanne ritchi . that always seems to lift your spirits . good idea , minion . but without him , what' s the point ? - " him , " sir ? - nothing . we' il just ... that' s something to consider ... ... and ... well , i think i' il just power down for a while then . he was always there for us .
dependable . perhaps we took him for granted . you know , maybe , we never really know how good we have it until it' s gone . we miss you , metro man . i miss you . and i have just one question for megamind : are you happy now ? this is roxanne ritchi , reporting from a city without a hero . coming up next , are you ready to be a slave army ? what you need to know .
and ... wrap that up and give it to a child on christmas , - ' cause we' re done . - ok . see you tomorrow , hal . wait . roxie , i' m having a party at my house . it' s gonna be , like , off the hook , or whatever . you should come over . i got a deejay , rented a bouncy house , made a gallon of dip . it' s gonna be sick .
oh . i ... i don' t know , hal . i don' t really feel like being around a bunch of people . no , no , no , that' s the best part . it' il just be like you and me . that ... that' s certainly very tempting , but ... i did hire a wedding photographer . that' s just in case we were like , something crazy happened and we wanted a picture of it . like , maybe we should have this for , like , ever .
like a memory , you know ? i' m gonna pass . i have some work here that i need to do , anyway . cool . so thursday ? soft thursday ? - good night , hal . - that' s a soft yes on thursday . what' s wrong with me ? rented a bouncy house ?
chicks don' t like bouncy houses . they like clowns . stupid van ! you broke my finger ! i' ve made a horrible mistake . i didn' t mean to destroy you . i mean , i meant to destroy you , but i didn' t think it would really work . what are we supposed to do ? without you , evil is running rampant through the streets . i' m so tired of running rampant through the streets .
what' s the point of being bad when there' s no good to try and stop you ? someone has to stop megamind . - hey , we' re closing soon . - you scared me . - barry , right ? - bernard . bernard . i was just ... well , i was talking to myself . you probably think i' m a little bit nuts .
i' m not allowed to insult guests directly . thank you . just ... bernard , i' il just be another minute . ok . thanks . i had so many evil plans in the works . the illiteracy beam . typhoon cheese . robo- sheep .
battles we will now never have . you know , i never had the chance to say goodbye . so it' s good that we have this time now . you know , before i destroy the place . nothing personal , it just brings back too many painful memories . hello ? - hello ? - roxanne . - that' s a pretty tasteless costume . - costume ?
megamind' s head is not that grossly exaggerated . and you even made a cheap replica of his dehydration gun . how ... hello ? is someone there ? who' s there ? it' s just you , bernard . yes . it' s just me . bernard .
well , thank you for letting me stay . look , i wouldn' t stay here for more than two minutes and 37 seconds if i were you . we' re having the walls and ceiling removed . wow , that sounds like quite the renovation . i guess i' il catch a ride down with you then . i kept thinking he was gonna do one of his last- minute escapes . he was really good at those . oh , if only the world had a reset button . i' ve looked into the reset button . the science is impossible .
oh , bernard ... i didn' t know you had ... feelings . are you ok ? metro man' s gone . and now there' s no one left to challenge megamind . oh , come on , bernard . as long as there' s evil , good will rise up against it . oh , i wish . i believe someone is gonna stand up to megamind . - you really think so ?
- yeah . i mean , it' s like they say , " heroes aren' t born , they' re made . " heroes can be made . that' s it ! all you need are the right ingredients . - yeah . bravery . - yes . - strength .
- of course . - determination . - imperative ! and a smidgen of dna . oh , with that , anyone can be a hero ! yeah ! i think we should run ! bye ! time to put the past behind us . only the future ...
i' m too close ! i' m genuinely scared right now . i hope no one' s seeing this ! create a hero ? wait , wait , what ? why would you do that ? so i have someone to fight . minion , i' m a villain without a hero . a ying with no yang . a bullfighter with no bull to fight .
in other words , i have no purpose . now , ask me how i' m going to do it . go on ! ask ! how are you gonna do it ? i' m going to give someone ... i don' t know who yet ... metro man' s powers . i' m going to train that someone to become metrocity' s new hero . over here !
follow ! and then finally , i' m going to fight that hero in an epic battle of good and evil . which will put everything back the way it was ... ... when the world was perfect and rosy . behold , minion , metro man' s cape . look closely . tell me what you see . - dandruff ? - yes . it' s his dna . from this , we' il extract the source of metro man' s awesome power .
sir , i think this is a bad idea . yes ! this is a very wickedly bad idea for the greater good of man . but i' m saying this is a kind of bad that ... ... ok , you might think is good in your bad perception , but from a good perception it ... it' s just plain bad . oh , you don' t know what' s good for bad . now , we have just one shot at this . we must find a suitable subject , someone of noble heart and mind . who puts the welfare of others above their own . what on earth is that ? it seems to be emanating from there , sir .
ollo . it' s " hello . " hello ? like that ? - bernard , it' s roxanne . - it' s roxanne . i just wanted to thank you for inspiring me the other day . - oh , you inspired me too . - great ! it' s time we stood up to megamind and show him he can' t push us around .
oh , really ? she' s so cute . i' m already hot on his trail . - and what gives you that idea ? - sir ? i just found his secret hideout . how did she find my hideout ? ! how did you find his hideout ? this is the only building in metro city with a fake observatory on the roof . there' s no way she' il find the secret entrance .
there' s a doormat here that says " secrit entrance " ! - minion ! - i kept forgetting where it was . she' il discover all our secrets ! - oh , no ! - you dim- witted creation of science ! - what ? - what ? oh , no , not you , roxanne . no , i was just yelling at my ... mother' s urn .
don' t do anything . i' il be right there . roxanne ? oh no , not again ! roxanne ? i' m glad you' re here . wait , how did you get here so fast ? well , i ... i happened to be speed walking nearby when you called . in a suit ?
it' s called ... formal speed walking , but that' s not important . i better take the lead . this way looks exciting . no , it says " exit . " which is the abbreviation for " exciting , " right ? this is the mother lode ! just look at this thing . - wow . you know , i really could use your help in deciphering all this . - really ?
- you' re an expert - on all things megamind , right ? - yes . right . together , we could figure out his plan for the city and stop it . - are you in ? - oh , what fun ! that' s what i want to hear . minion , code : send in the brain- bots .
you know , the whole point of a code is ... oh , code : just do it , minion . - it' s me , you fools ! - bernard ! it' s daddy ! megamind . - what have you done with bernard ? - oh , bernard ? oh , yes .
i' m doing horrible things to that man . i don' t want to get into it , but lasers , spikes . no , please ! no ! not the lasers and the spikes ! - you know the drill . - oh , no ! not the drill ! - let him go or ... - or what ?
or i' m gonna find out what this weird- looking gun does . no , don' t shoot ! don' t shoot that gun ! i' il just go get him . - unhand me , you fiend ! - never ! his strength' s too much ! oh , i work out ! well , it' s really paying off ! you' re so fit , and strangely charismatic .
are you ok ? i did my best , but he' s too fantastic . here . let me carry that heavy gun for you . i got us covered . - let go . it' s mine ! - bernard , run ! roxanne ? - you' re going to break it !
- give it to me ! oh , no ! roxanne ? ! who on earth is that ? - help ! - roxanne ! bernard ! you were right about that door being exciting . - intruder ! intruder !
- this way . intruder ! what are you doing ? this' il stop them . here ! seems a bit extreme , doesn' t it ? - just throw it ! - daddy' s sorry . that was really exciting . - yeah .
- you were very strong in there . i' ve never seen anyone but metro man stand up to him like that . - what' s going on ? - hal , what happened ? i think a bee flew up my nose . i was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you , but like 50 ninjas tried to attack me , so i had to beat ' em all up , and i did , and i ... they were all , like , crying and stuff ... - wow , a brave one , isn' t he ? - who are you ? oh , thi ... this is bernard .
he' s my partner . - partner ? - yes . yes . partner . well , look , " partner , " i' m her partner . she doesn' t know what she' s saying . she' s been through a traumatic experience . i' d better take him home . thanks again , bernard .
i' il call you tomorrow , partner . yeah , ok . i' d like that . that was weird for everybody , ' cause you accidentally hugged him instead of me . sir ? sir ! code : did you find out who it was ? code :
get the car . code : right away , sir . - bye- bye ! - see you tomorrow , hal . i' il leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later . who is this man we' ve infused with godlike power ? well , sir , his name' s hal stewart . he' s 28 years old . no criminal record .
actually no records at all . apparently this man hasn' t accomplished anything . not yet , minion . not ... yet . could this day get anymore fun- tastic ? so , i will just go ahead and diffuse him since this is clearly a mistake . no , minion ! there' s something much more powerful at work here . this is no mistake . it' s destiny .
hal shtewart ! prepare for your destiny ! hal ? hal shtewart ? in the bed ! - am i saying it right ? " stewart . " is this a robbery ? ' cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me . oh , look , it' s hal stewart .
quick , the spray . all out . - well , use the forget- me stick . - oh , right . just look at him . no , he doesn' t look quite the hero- type to me . oh , you' re such a pill , minion . a potter couldn' t ask for finer clay . i smell a hero . i smell something burning .
i think it' s working . places ! places ! places ! places ! do you have your disguise ? what ? oh , you look fantastic . rise my glorious creation . rise , and come to papa .
- what' s going on ? - easy my child . - who are you ? - i sent you to this planet to teach you about justice , honor , and nobility . i am your father . so you' re like my space dad ? yeah , i' m like your space dad . and you are what ? i' m your space stepmom . i' ve had some work done recently .
is this some kind of dream ? this is a dream come true . you' ve been blessed with unfathomable power . - what kind of power ? - unfathomable . it' s unf ... without fathom . we' ve come to guide you on your path to be metrocity' s new hero and battle the super- genius of megamind . i know this is a lot to take in . it may take months for you to come to grips . no freaking way !
i wasn' t finished . i' m gonna be a hero ! i' m gonna be a hero ! see , minion , he' s perfect ! and ... action ! - someone help me ! - i' m ok ! zap ! zap ! zap !
the flames of my evil burn bright . now you say something cool back at me . look . it doesn' t even hurt . don' t even feel it . no , no , no , no , no . stomach down , hands up . like metro man . - whoa ! wait !
- watch out . he' s hopeless . hopeless ! - maybe we should change tactics . - you think so ? oh , you know how boys are . they love video games . - i could throw a few parts together . - can' t wait . lol .
smiley face . can' t wait for what , sir ? that was such a funny story . and brilliantly told , by the way . ok , now you tell one . bernard , i never knew you were so funny . and i never heard you laugh before . yeah , it' s been a while . feels pretty good . and action .
- you don' t get out much , do you ? - oh , what fun ! i used to come here with my mother when i was a kid . it was one of my favorite things to do . now look at it . it' s a dump . why are we cleaning up the city , sir ? well , we don' t want to battle our new hero in a dump now , do we ? they' re all back . but how ?
why ? maybe megamind isn' t so bad after all . that' s it . be free , my beautiful dove ! ok , ok . metro man and i were never a couple . - but i thought you two were ... - i know . everybody did . it' s just ...
well , he was never really my type . really ? ok , now you tell me something . something you' ve never told anyone . well , in sh ... school ... ... none of the other kids really liked me . i was always the last one picked for everything . it' s too bad that we didn' t go to the same school . hal , i think you' re ready for this . - do i have a son ? - no .
you make me laugh . it stretches . it' s for you . hey , what' s the t stand for ? titan . " titan " ? what' s that supposed to mean ? it was the only name i could trademark . do you have someone special in your life , hal ? no , not yet .
but ... there' s this really , really good- looking one i' ve got my eye on currently . that' s very good . - romance is very inspiring . - that' s what i hear . all you have to do is save her and she' il be yours . - who wants churros ? - i do ! - i do , yeah . thanks , space stepmom .
- churros all the way around . on the count of three , unsheathe your churro . one , two , three ! to titan ! tomorrow , you will fight megamind , and the city will know your name . ... the city' s parks restored to their original glory , the streets the safest they' ve been , the banks reopened . has something happened to megamind ? has someone tamed this monster ? this is roxanne ritchi , cautiously optimistic , and pleasantly confused . well , you seem in a very good mood tonight , sir .
oh , yes . how long is this going to take , minion ? just a few alterations , sir , and i will be done with your most terrifying cape yet ! i' m calling it ... ... the black mamba ... black mamba . perfect . gosh , i am running late . i have to go . what ? where ...
where are you going , sir ? we have our debut battle with titan tomorrow morning . we haven' t even tested your big battle suit yet . you attend to the details , minion . i have to ... run a quick errand . you don' t run errands . - what' s going on here ? - what ? oh , wait a minute . are you wearing jean paul gaultier' s pour homme ?
it' s just my natural musk . now , where are the car keys ? this is about ms. ritchi , isn' t it ? you' re going on a date with her . no , my main man . get out of town . oh , this is bad . this is bad . you' ve fallen in love with her . you are forgetting your place , minion .
now give me the keys . what happens when roxanne finds out who you really are ? she will never find out . that' s the point of lying . honestly , if i didn' t know any better , i' d think this was your first day of being evil . no ! this has gone far enough ! oh , that was really grown- up ! sir , sir , please .
it' s for your own good . oh , what do you know ? i may not know much , but i do know this : the bad guy doesn' t get the girl . maybe i don' t want to be the bad guy anymore . you heard me ! who are you ? - now , give me the keys ! - no ! my sole purpose in life is to look after you .
well , i don' t need you to look after me . what are you s ... what are you saying ? you don' t need me ? let me make it clear . code : i don' t need you . you know what ? you know what ? code :
i' il just pack my thing and go ! - code : fine ! - code : fine back ! - well , good luck on your date ! - i will ! - that doesn' t even make any sense ! - i know ! i know i am so close .
i can feel it . ok , ok . i just have to take a step back . wait a minute . " titan . " - what' s a titan ? - my super- ears are burning . i usually just hear criminals . you haven' t been naughty , have you ? i' m totally messing with you .
i' m totally messing with you . - the name' s titan . - titan . your very own heroic guardian of pure awesome . what' s your name ? just kidding . i know everything about you . and i ... and i brought some flowers . didn' t know what you liked , so i just grabbed , you know , all of them .
ok . you don' t like flowers ? ok , forget the flowers . what do you want ? thought maybe we could go for a little flight around town . get to know each other first . this must be very thrilling for you . what do you think you' re doing ? ! oh , am i moving too fast ? you' re probably right .
i should just rescue you a few times before we get all romantic . saved ya . you are lucky to have such a great hero here . - oh , no ! somebody do something ! oh , right , right , duh . i gotcha . that was a close one . you almost died , - but i saved you .
- building ! gotcha ! i' m sorry . what were you saying ? i couldn' t hear you over the sound of me saving your life . put me down ! right now ! ok , all right . all right , hold on . are you crazy ?
i suppose i' m a , i' m a little crazy , about you . who are you , really ? oh , right . well , prepare to have your mind blown , little lady . - ta- da . - hal ? yeah . isn' t this great ? now there' s nothing keeping us apart . - no .
it' s not great . - wow . our first fight . this is so us . we' re like an old married couple . look , there is no " us , " ok ? there will never be an " us . " but ... i have powers . i have a cape .
i' m the good guy . you are a good guy , hal , but you don' t understand . - we need to find out why ... - no , no . this ... - hal , just take a deep breath - this isn' t right ! - and listen to me for a moment . i' m trying to warn you , hal . it' s titan ! it' s titan , not hal ! - bernard .
- roxanne . - sorry i' m late . - wow , your hair looks exciting . not the only exciting development of the night . megamind' s created a new hero , and i know why . it all makes sense now . he missed getting his butt kicked , so he created a new hero - to kick it for him . - yeah . but why would he pick hal ?
hal is the worst possible person you could pick . wow . that' s a lot to take in . it boggles my mind . i am extremely boggled . you know , i' m sure we' il get to the bottom of who' s kicking whose butt . but in the meantime , let' s enjoy each other' s company . i' m sorry , bernard , of course , you' re right . you know , i could use a breather . to bernard , for being the only normal thing in my crazy , upside- down world .
to ... being normal . - roxanne ? - yes ? say i wasn' t so normal . let' s say i was bald and had the complexion of , of a popular primary color , as a random , nonspecific example . - would you still enjoy my company ? - of course ! you don' t judge a book by its cover or a person from the outside . that' s a relief to hear . you judge them based on their actions .
well , that seems kind of petty , don' t you think ? what ? what ? don' t look at me ! just a technical glitch ! don' t look yet ! well , never mind that . where were we ? - now , now , hold on . you !
i can explain ! what about everything you just said ? about judging a book by its cover ? well , let' s take a look at the contents then , shall we ? you destroyed metro man , you took over the city , and then , you actually got me to care about you ! why are you so evil ? tricking me ? what could you possibly hope to gain ? wait a minute . i don' t believe this .
do you really think that i would ever be with you ? no . ok , minion ! you were right ! i was ... less right ! we should stick to what we' re good at ... being bad . minion ? you there ! yeah , you . bring out the black mamba .
ok , titan . it' s time to go down in style . i hear there' s a new hero who dares challenge my evil . where is the one they call titan ? challenge me if you dare ! oh no . we' re gonna crash ! this is embarrassing . of all the inconsiderate , bone- headed ... ... irresponsible , rude ... unprofessional , that' s what this is !
would metro man have kept me waiting ? of course not ! hey , megamind ! you' re actually the guy i want to see . also , there' s a door here . do you have any idea how long i waited for you ? no , no , no , i totally understand what you' re saying . could you just , just shut up for one second . i' m trying to beat this level . were you even planning on showing up ?
what' s this ? where did you get all this stuff ? it doesn' t belong to me . - you stole it ? - pretty cool , right ? - no , no , no , no ! you' re a hero ! - being a hero is for losers ! it' s work , work , work , 24/ 7 , and for what ? i only took the gig to get the girl , and it turns out roxanne doesn' t want anything to do with me .
- roxanne ritchi ? - yeah ! roxanne ritchi ! i saw her having dinner and making googly eyes at some intellectual dweeb ! who needs all that noise ? that' s why i think we should team up . you ... wait ... what ? with my power , and your big- headedness ,
- we could rule the city ! - you want to team up ? i even drew up some new costume designs , see ? - costume designs ? - you' d be the brains , so you' d get a little brain , wearing glasses on your costume , or something . and since i' m the cool one , i' d have , like , two tanks sword fighting ... i can' t believe you . all your gifts , all your powers , and you ... you squander them for your own personal gain . - yes ! - no !
i' m the villain ! you' re the good guy ! i do something bad , and you come and get me ! that' s why i created you . yeah , right . you' re nuts . space dad told me ... look , i' m your space dad ! you should be more like metro man . - you tricked me ?
- oh , don' t like that ? well , there' s more . i' m also the intellectual dweeb dating roxanne . - no . - and we were smooching up a storm ! when i get my hands on you , i' m gonna ... yes ! yes , i know ! bring me to justice . oh god , how i' ve missed this .
and the hero strikes the first blow . but evil returns with a backhand ! yes ! come out , you little freak ! i want to see what that big brain looks like on the pavement ! you fell for the oldest evil trick in the book ! you little blue twerp ! en garde ! oh , now that' s the spirit ! parry !
thrust ! parry again ! now it' s time for some witty back and forth banter ! you go first ! look , i' m not sure where to go with that ! this one' s for stealing my girlfriend ! this one' s for space dad making a fool out of me ! and , megamind , this one' s for space stepmom ! well done . i thought that battle went really , really well .
- i mean , i have a few notes . - notes ? but they can wait . you can take me to jail now . oh , no , no , no . i was thinking more like the morgue . you' re dead ! whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . this isn' t how you play the game . game over .
brain- bots ! i' m calling time out ! time out ? time out ! brain- bots , initiate the fail- safe . guess what , buster brown ? it' s made from copper . you' re powerless against it . it' s the very same metal used to defeat ... metro man ?
you should stop comparing me to metro man ! you can run , megamind , but you can' t hide ! we' re saved ! we' re saved ! what' s your name , new hero ? - it' s titan . - thank you ! thank you ! titan has freed us ! oh , i wouldn' t say " free . "
more like under new management . - what do you want ? - titan' s turned evil . congratulations . another one of your genius plans has backfired on you . and why did my doorman let you up ? carlos . please , roxanne , no . no . i need your help .
why do you need my help ? because you' re the smartest person i know . but you can' t hide here . the copper should have worked . why didn' t the copper work ? the copper worked perfectly well last time . copper ? you' re not making any sense . look , if we don' t find titan' s weakness , he' il destroy the whole city . - ok , how can i help ?
- we need to find answers . you knew metro man best . did he have a hideout ? a cave ? a solitary fortress of some kind ? anything that would give us clues . well ... there is one place i know . you gave him these powers . can' t you just take them away ? i can' t .
i lost my diffuser gun when i misplaced the invisible car . the night you dumped me . alone . in the rain . did you ever look back ? - no ! - my giant blue head ! i guess we' re here . so , this is where he hid it . after all these years .
my old shoolhouse . you know , i think there' s an apology in order for the other night . ok , that would be nice , but make it quick . we have much more pressing matters to deal with . wow . i can' t believe he kept all this stuff . i remember when he wore that . - shouldn' t we try to stay focused here ? - yes , of course . right .
focused . come over and look at this . what is it ? what did you find ? look . this glass has ice cubes in it . yes , that' s what happens when water gets cold . no , what i' m saying is , don' t you think it' s a little odd that the ice hasn' t melted yet ? one of life' s great mysteries . hey .
we now have confirmed reports . titan , first thought to be this city' s new hero , has turned evil . the city has never seen this level of destruction . if only metro man were still alive . - you' re alive ? - you' re alive . - i' m alive . - but i , we ... we saw your skeleton ! you were dead !
are you a ghost ? there had better be an amazing explanation for this . speak , apparition . ok . ok , ok , ok . you both deserve the truth . it all started back at the observatory . roxanne was kidnapped . i was gonna stop you . my head wasn' t in the game that day .
we were kind of going through the motions . so ... using my super- speed , i decided to go clear my head . fire ! then i realized , we had done this same silly charade our entire lives . i tried to get my mind off how i was feeling , but i just felt stuck . i began to realize , despite all my powers , each and every citizen of metro had something i didn' t : a choice . ever since i can remember , i' ve always had to be what the city wanted me to be . but what about what i wanted to do ? then it suddenly hit me .
i do have a choice . i can be whatever i want to be . no one said this hero thing had to be a lifetime gig . you can' t just quit , either . that' s when i got the brilliant idea ... to fake my death . copper drains my powers . your weakness is copper ? once your death ray hit , i' d never felt so alive . so i borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school . metro man was finally dead .
and music man was born ! - music man ? - that way i could keep my logo . - ' cause of wha ... ? - come again ? i was finally free to get in touch with my true power ... ... weaving lyrical magic . check this out . i have eyes that can see right through lead ... - you' re horrible !
- granted , you have talent . but there' s a madman out there destroying our ... your city . how could you do this ? ! the people of this city relied on you , and you deserted them ! you left us in the hands of him ! - no offense . - no , i' m with you . look , we need your help . i' m sorry . i really am .
i' m done . you know , little buddy , there' s a ying for every yang . if there' s bad , good will rise up against it . it' s taken me a long time to find my calling . now it' s about time you find yours . hey , who needs him ? we can beat titan ourselves . i say we go back to the evil lair , grab some ray guns , hold him sideways , and just go all gangsta on him . we can' t . so that' s it ?
you' re just giving up ? i' m the bad guy . i don' t save the day , i don' t fly off into the sunset , and i don' t get the girl . i' m going home . unless someone comes to our aid soon , all may be lost . thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus . remaining citizens are warned to stay indoors until further notice . authorities have issued a warning to stay out of the downtown area at all costs . hal ! hal !
let me guess . after seeing how awesome i am , you' ve finally come to your senses ? well , i' m over you . - i' ve come to stop you , hal . - you ? oh , wow . ok , what are you gonna do , report me to death ? i was going to try reasoning with you . you and i , we worked together for a long time . i know you .
you don' t know me . you never took the time to know me . this is the first time we' ve hung out socially , and it' s when i' m about to destroy the city ! i want to talk to the real hal . i want to talk to the guy who loved being a cameraman , and eating dip , and being a nerd , and being not as scary as the tighten hal . too late ! megamind ! you and i have some unfinished business . i' il be waiting at metro tower . oh , and just so you don' t get cold feet ...
roxanne . come on , roxie , call for your hero to come rescue you . megamind , i don' t even know if you' re listening , but if you are , you can' t give up . the megamind i knew would never have run from a fight , even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning . it was your best quality . you need to be that guy right now . the city needs you . i need you . roxanne . you have one hour .
don' t keep me waiting . warden ! warden ! listen to me ! you have to let me go ! tighten has to be stopped ! sorry , megamind . you still have 88 life sentences to go . plenty of time to reflect on what you' ve done . did you want to hear me say it ?
i' il say it . here it is , from the blackest part of my heart . i am sorry ! not buying it . i don' t blame you . i' ve terrorized this city countless times . created a hero who' s turned out to be a villain . i lied to roxanne , and ... ... my best friend minion , i treated like dirt . please don' t make this city ... ... don' t make roxanne pay for my wrongdoings . apology accepted .
oh , minion , you fantastic fish , you . what are we waiting for ? we' d better get going . you got me . - good luck , fellas ! - we' re gonna die ! wait , what ? hey , metro losers . this is metro tower . they say it' s supposed to be a symbol of our city' s strength .
but for me , it' s a reminder of the day this woman ferociously ripped out my heart . and i hate reminders ! help ! please don' t do this . i know there' s still good in you , hal . you' re so naive , roxie . you see the good in everybody , even when it' s not there . you' re living a fantasy . there is no easter bunny , there is no tooth fairy , and there is no queen of england . this is the real world , and you need to wake up !
you dare challenge megamind ? this town isn' t big enough for two super- villains ! oh , you' re a villain all right ! just not a super one ! yeah ? what' s the difference ? presentation ! - i knew you' d come back . - well , that made one of us . - what' s the plan ?
- well , it mostly involves not dying . i like that plan . building ! go faster ! make this thing go faster ! i can' t control it ! no . well , that was easy . looks like there' s only one loose end now . please , let' s have a little respect for public transportation .
you came back ! you were right , roxanne . i never should have left . i ... i thought you were dead . my death was ... greatly exaggerated . so , you' re the punk i' ve heard about . i' m sorry . i did the best i could . i' m so proud of you .
minion ? surprise ! he' s the real hero . megamind . going somewhere ? besides jail ? no , not in the face , man . please . if you know what' s good for you , tighten , you' il stay out of metrocity ! - you got it !
- for good ! pretty sneaky , sis . but there' s only one person i know who calls this town " metrocity . " you . bet you think it' s really funny ? let' s all laugh at the really cool guy ? well , you' re not gonna be laughing for long . the invisible car . hey ! remember that night that i dumped you ?
you' re bringing this up now ? well , i did look back ! you did ? you did ? yes ! and you should look back right now ! oh , i get it ! this is the last time you make a fool out of me ! i made you a hero . you did the fool thing all by yourself .
you' re so pathetic . no matter what side you' re on , you' re always the loser . there' s a benefit to losing . you get to learn from your mistakes . oh , you' ve got to be kidding me ! minion , if i live , i will kill you . enjoy your flight ! megamind ! so this is how it ends . normally , i' d chalk this up to my last glorious failure .
but not today . what can i say ? old habits die hard . say bye- bye , roxie . ollo . the thing about bad guys , they always lose ! - you did it . you won . i finally had a reason to win . you .
minion ! can' t see . it' s cold and ... warm , and dark and light . it' s me , minion . i' m right here . we' ve had a lot of adventures together , you and i. we have , minion . i mean ... most of them ended in horrible failure , but we won today . didn' t we , sir ? yes , minion , we did it .
thanks to you . code : we' re the good guys now . code : i guess we are . oh , oh , oh , i' m going ! i think this , this is it ! i' m going ... going far ... what a drama queen . you know , i' m feeling much better now .
i guess i just needed a swim . he had you , didn' t he ? classic minion . don' t give me that face . he reels you in with that little face . - look at that face . - we did it ! we did it ! - fist pump ! - you did it !
we won , we won , we won ! get back , you savages ! sorry ! sorry . he' s just not used to positive feedback . funny , i guess destiny is not the path given to us ... ... but the path we choose for ourselves . all right , put your hands in the air . now hand over your wallets . i' m just kidding !
just kidding ! i have to admit , being good has its perks . you know , you look pretty good in white . megamind , if you plea ... hey . my kid can' t see . sorry , my friend . way to go , little buddy . i knew he had it in him . ladies and gentlemen ,
megamind , defender of metro city ! you know , i like the sound of that . hit it ! i' m bad ! i' m bad ! sir , you really need to empty your pockets more often . this has been the worst day of my entire life . no worries . i can' t believe that i didn' t get a pedicure for this . how embarrassing .
look at that . if i were with a real guy doing this i would have gotten a pedicure , and a wax . oh shit , that one’ s worse ! - sorry i didn' t get a pedicure . - what ? uh , my toes . i am sorry . i' m not looking at your toes , - i' m looking at your cervix . - right .
now i kind of wish you were looking at my toes . - all done . - that' s it ? we' il , uh , elevate your legs for 10 minutes and you' il be good to go . this is the first i hear the ticking clock sound and i' m not freaking out . good . just relax . i can' t , i' m totally freaking out ! oh , come on , everything is going to be great . i have a feeling that you and , um , crm- 1014 are going to make beautiful babies together .
thank you . oh god , i hope this works . i wanted this for so long . maybe this isn' t how i pictured it ... exactly , thought i would have a little more support . no , you don' t want kids ! trust me . well that’ s easy for you to say , you have four . and it' s awful . they' ve ruined my life ! what ? !
no , go away ! have you seen my vagina ? i mean have you ? but i wouldn' t show it to you , i will show it to you just to prove you do not want to have kids . i will show you , my vagina ! i don' t want to see that , i want to have a baby . i just think you' re tired of being alone , you haven' t met the right guy ... it' s not about a guy , this isn' t about a guy i' ve dated hundreds of guys over the past five years not one of them is close to being the one . it' s just not happening for me .
yeah , but that does not mean that it won' t . - doesn' t mean that it will . - is that my chicken ? ! what are you doing ? ! that is your dinner , not a toy ! i hate them . do you smell pee ? so i had to figure it out on my own . i examined every possibility and arrived at the most logical conclusion . would you be my baby daddy ?
what ? ! no , i can' t be the father , are you out of your mind ? ! what are you talking ... no , no ! i' m in my sexual prime , alright ! i have countless more women to bed before i do something idiotic as having a baby . clyde , you' re my friend . don' t you want to help me ? i mean , we don' t have to have sex . you don' t have to be involved at all .
alright ? just ... give me your sperm . oh , oh . ok . ok . you' re ... you' re feeling lonely , alright ? maybe a little ... a little dead down there . i get it , i get it . long time since you had uh ... you know ... - j .. just shut up !
ok ! just forget it ! forget the whole thing . - what ? well that was a bust . so i took life by the , uh ... horns ? and i ... i did what i had to do . yeah . it' s going to be ok . i have a plan .
- whoa , you don' t have to walk like that ! - well , oh ... ok . uh , by the way , i know a excellent support group for single moms , if you' re interested . great ! great . maybe we should hug ? we might have just made a baby together . - good luck . - okay . alright .
- hi . - hi . - hi ! - get away from me ! taxi ! excuse me , this is my cab . - what , you own it ? - no , but i' m about to rent it . if you see someone hail a cab and a cab pulls up you can' t just jump in the cab and say it yours ? - i didn' t see you .
- i saw you see me . sir ? sir ... excuse me who saw you first ? look , maybe you' re not from around here but there is a code , you know there are certain rules we try to follow ... fine ! forget it , i get out ! but not because your right but because i am in a terrific mood and you' re ruining it . no , i' il get out . - now what ? - i don' t know , you tell me ?
- hey , hey , hey ! - where' s it going ? come back ! well , that was stupid ! why did you get out ? ! you stupid head ! you said you were in a good mood and i was ruining it . i felt bad . i' m sorry , did you tell me a stupid head ? how is your great mood now ?

ok , alright . welcome to single mothers and proud . as the name suggests we are all single ... mothers and , uh , proud . some of us have adopted some of us have conceived with a donor , every stories is different , but with the same common denominator wanted a child and we made it happen on our own . we sure did , we sure did . are you already a single mother or you trying to become one ? i was just inseminated a few days ago . inseminated , makes me feel like a cow or something . well , we do what we have to do when we don' t have a penis partner . so , let’ s hear about you .
oh , ok . let' s see ... i own a pet store . yeah , i use to work in the corporate world . which was great for a while but just didn' t feel like the life i wanted to live . so , now i am happy on the work front but , you know , i don' t know even though i have more balance , personal ... i still haven' t found the one . well , the elusive one . good luck . if i had a dollar for every time i hear that .
i thought i' d be married with kids by now but that’ s just not happening so , i guess it’ s time for my backup plan . well , zoe listen , if you really want a baby we here at single mothers and proud ... ah ha ... we can be your partners . from inception to graduation , everything in between we can be here for you . great . dakota was born here , in this very room . right where you are sitting actually . really ? right here ?
imagine that . so how old is your baby , now ? i' m three . so cute . why do you need a support group ? - you' re not very supportive . - what ? you just told me that if i breast feed , my girls are going to end up looking like empty tube socks . hey , i' m just being honest . don' t even get me started on what child birth does to your bladder .
what does it do to your bladder ? oh , i just peed a little bit . i don' t think i' m pregnant anyways . the doctor said it would take a few tries . something about frozen sperm being lazy . oh , come with me for a minute i have to make some muffins for some bullshit teacher' s appreciation day . you' re going to make muffins ? oh hell no . there is a place here that sells them ,
i pick out the worse ones and i pretend that i made them . come on . okay . which is the ugliest ? it seems too much trouble over something so trivial . welcome to motherhood . there' s that guy ? what guy ? the one selling cheese i know him . he' s hot .
he sells cheese ? you sell hamsters . can i help you ladies ? no , we' re good , thank you . like what you see ? what ? just talking about the muffins . - hey you . - hey . hi what .. what a nice surprise !
how did you know i worked here ? i didn' t . oh , ok . did you follow me here ? follow you ? to the farmers market , are you kidding me ? we ... we came to buy muffins . you where here , tell him . well , you better buy something , because you ate all my samples . it' s really nice to see you , i never got your name .
- i' m stan . - oh , zoe . i' m mona . so how do you two not know each other ? - he stole my cab . - she stole my cab . oh , ok . we should go . we should ? yeah , we have that important thing .
well , can your important thing wait for a few minutes ? i' il give you a taste of my cheese . i can rephrase that . ok , this is our basic chevre . probably our best seller , or the cheese that started it all as they say . these are our surface ripen cheeses , these are fantastic . and these are the aged raw milk cheeses . now ... this is really boring , isn' t it ? - uh , yes .
- um , no . this is louie , he works for me . - hi - hi , zoe can i get you a sample box ? um , i' m ok . you' re not lactose intolerant are you ? i hate that . hey , you' re still coming over tonight right ? i ... um , yeah , yeah . we should go .

so let’ s just get back to work . - finding a relationship is work ... - i do not want a relationship . well , it is . so dogs have a ingrain pack mentality . if we don' t assert leadership over our dogs our dogs are going to show unstable behaviour or dominate behaviour . in other words , in the dog world , who you are is stable or unstable energy . a leader or a follower . so , when a dog introduces himself to another dog , what do they do ?
exactly . when a human wants meet a dog ... oh my god ! he' s so ... so , i mean , it’ s like poor dog .. and so they' re interacting based on energy and also the nose ... ok , now this is getting weird . i know we keep running into each other , it' s crazy . oh , so your being here , is just another coincidence ? oh no , i love this guy .
- don' t you have some place to be tonight ? - not ' til later . - do you even have a dog ? - no . but i might get one now that i can be the pack leader . i' m really busy here . ok so , you have a boyfriend or something . just tell me , i can take it . or you' re just no , you' re not interested in me ? you' re making a big mistake , i am very interesting .
i' m just not interested in men right now . oh , you ... you' re gay ? i' m not gay ! hey you two , would you please take it outside ? - sorry . - ok , sorry , sorry about that . this is not a good time for me , ok . i' m going through some changes . menopause ? menopause ?
seriously ? how old do think i am ? ok , you know , let’ s start over , because the more i think about it , we' d never make it as a couple anyway . you' re way too sceptical , we should be friends . i have enough friends . you can never have too many friends . what are you doing tonight ? getting take out and going home to bed . clearly you don' t have that many friends . ok , here' s my proposition and don' t freak out because it require very little commitment .
i' m getting take out too , let' s walk together towards the same place , order and pay for our own respective meals and we' il say goodbye . where do you want to go ? thank you . no fair , you chose this place because it takes two seconds . no , i chose it because it' s the best . alright , well i want to see you take a bite of that . i don' t believe you' il eat it . fine . there , happy now ?
you have no idea how good this is . i cannot believe you lived new york your whole life and you' ve never gone to gray' s papaya . what' s wrong with you ? actually i haven' t lived here all my life . we moved out of the city when my parents bought the farm . no , not die , they actually ... they bought a farm and we moved upstate . they retired to phoenix five years ago , and i run the place now . what about your family ? actually my parents died when i was young . it' s just me and my grandmother now .
i' m sorry , i' m so sorry . it' s ok , it was long time ago . i really have to go . alright , but i cannot let you walk home alone because ... this is very dangerous neighbourhood . what school did you go to ? well , i kind of dropped out . i met this swedish girl during my semester abroad ... let me guess , you fell in love and got married . - and started an inn in vermont . - of course .
it lasted like three seconds , i didn' t know how to run an inn and she didn' t know how not to sleep the everyone that worked there , so ... - ouch - we got divorced , yeah ... she took everything . i had to move back in with my parents . work myself out of debt , and tried to figure out how not to blame every women on the planet for honest harish ways . how' s that going ? not so good . ok , i want to know everything . first kiss ?
some jerk with a dirt bike and chapped lips . you ? 7th grade , she wore braces and head gear - it was terrifying . - ouch hey , look . - here' s one for you . - that' s weird . ok , best kiss ? um , that' s a tough one .
because , if we weren' t just friends . i' d kiss you right now , and i' d be your best kiss . how do you know ? i know . someone looking for you ? yeah , i have to go . - okay . - okay . - bye . - bye .
i' il call you . you think it was the muffin girl ? i guess ... i don' t know . why do i even care ? you like him ! ow ! what if i' m pregnant ? then it' il work out perfectly . - what do you mean ?
- because , if you really like him , as soon as that happens you' il break up with him because you' re pregnant and you wouldn' t have to put yourself out there , possibly get hurt . hey , that' s your dream . ah , besides ... i' m not pregnant . and i' m ok on my own . you' re going to see him again ? yeah , i think so . it' s not going to happen nutzy . hello . oh , stan .

- i' il take that as a yes . i guess you' il never know . i guess not . - except you left the price tag on . - what ? allow me . i got it . you know , i had this dress for a long time , it' s just i haven' t worn it yet . it' s why the tag still on . you' re not that special .
really ? look at this place . i don' t know what to say . finally . what' s that suppose to mean ? ! it just means good . don' t say anything . you don' t have to say anything . you know , just come over here , sit down . you think i talk too much ?
- i did not say that . - so what' d you say ? it' s just you' re very quick , you always have an response for things . which i like , but tonight , just you know , just be surprised . surprise . you' re good . - so you work for an internet company ? - uh huh . - i don' t see that at all . - oh , i was a very important person .
you would have been very impressed . - really ? - uh huh . how did you get the pet store ? actually it was due to my dog , nuts . i bought him at this fancy dog store near my house . cutest puppy you' ve ever seen . 6 months later he almost dies . turns out he was from one of those puppy mills , where the dogs are so in bred , he was falling apart . what did you do ?
did you sue them ? i thought about it , but then i thought what good would that do , they' il still sell in bred dogs , so i quit my job , and i took the stock option money over to the pet store , and i bought it . i know how to milk a goat does that do anything for you ? no , not really . can i ask you a serious question zoe ? what ? did you buy that dress to wear for me tonight ? i will never tell . really ?
because , uh ... i have ways of making you talk . let me get that , let me get that . oh ! hose ... hose over there behind the fence . you see it ? got the hose ? ok , this is war . you weren' t even pointing at the fire , you were pointing at my face . i wasn' t even trying to soak you , i swear .
whatever , i looked into your eyes and saw you had this crazy look , like a crazy person not true . it is true and ... you know what else , i think i owe you another dress . and i definitely own you another date . well , i' d like that . why don' t you come to the farm with me next weekend ? i' il call you . i' il wait by the phone . what ? holly shit !
i know . are you sure ? if i' m not then my dog is . you' re not making any sense . so you' re definitely pregnant ? congratulations how we feeling ? - we' re freaking out ! - what she said . why ? we preformed an intrauterine insemination using sperm that you purchased .
this isn' t exactly what we call an accident . it' s just happening so fast . keep breathing . pump those arms . what did you all eat last night ? - hey arthur . - well , hello my dear . oh no , no , don' t get up . it' s ok . i can' t get up .
- came to see my lovely fiancée ? - yes . oh , she' s looking fine today , let me tell you , just fine . - hi sweetheart . - hey . - i need to talk to you . - sure . alone . surely ! don' t worry about them , they can' t hear anything anyways .
i am pregnant . - what ? - i' m pregnant . - how what ? - i' m pregnant . i cannot hear you darling . oh jesus , judy , she' s pregnant ! turn up your hearing aid . i' m confused ... you said that this was what you wanted . but this guy , he' s special .
now the whole thing is going to fall apart . what makes him so special ? i do not know , he' s very ... real , and funny . and different . i like him nana . what should i do ? zoe , you always get ahead of yourself . you barely know him . spend some time with him , see what he' s really like . he could be a total douche bag and then the whole thing is moot .
- maybe he is a douche bag . - oh come on . you really think he would ask you away for the weekend if he had a girlfriend ? there' s no way he' s dating that muffin bitch , zoe . trust me . who can say ? maybe he' s looking to get laid ? well , don' t have sex with him , ok ? you can' t - because that would really complicate things .
- i know . oh , it’ s going to be hard though with three times the blood coursing through your body . excuse me ? oh , yeah . that' s why pregnant women are so horney all the time . is that what it is ? i thought it was me . no , when i was pregnant my body was so sensitive i could have an orgasm sitting on a bus . i think i' m going to get sick .
- me too . - what ? it' s a happy story . alright , i' m just going to go up there and tell him that i' m pregnant - just lower my cards on the table . - ok , good . just don' t lay on the table . ok , because you cannot have sex . don' t look at me like that . i know , this is a big mess we' re in .
i' m going to fix it . shit , here it is . watch out for that tree . yeah , thanks . - hi . - hi . the tree should not have been there , that' s all i' m going to say . whatever mrs. magoo . - oh , ok . - come on now , i am glad you' re here .
me too . stan , there' s something i need to tell you . i am pregnant . yes , pregnant . i' m going to have a baby . i' m with child . shit . stan ... stan ... stan ...

i knew you liked it . so , what' s the next step for a cheese farmer ? very funny . i want to start a sustainable gourmet shop , okay . cheese , wine , bread , prepared foods . but everything local , nothing from farther than 30 miles . all based on the farmers markets . - that' s a good idea . - thank you very much . i' m good at ideas , i' m just not good with follow through .
i wasn' t good at marriage , i wasn' t good at running a bed and breakfast , thank god we didn' t have kids . you don' t want kids ? i don' t think so . well , i don' t know . for years i' ve never thought about the future , just kind of lived in the moment . but maybe i' m different now . i really want to take the next step , i want to move on with my life . - about the future ...
- uh huh . - let' s talk about that . - ok . because the future is now . - right ? - right . there' s something i need to tell you . hold that thought . come here . - i want to show you something .
- what is it ? - it' s cheese . - i can see that . no , no , no , it' s new . i had this idea to use these two different types of goat' s milk to come up with something really unique . it' s sweet and sassy and complex . i was inspired . so what are you saying ? i' m your cheese muse ? yeah .
you' re kind of hard to read right now . well , i really want to kiss you , but it smells like cheese in here . we have to ... take it slow , okay ? - we can' t have sex . - fine . ok ... ok ... ok ... ok ... did you just ...
holly shit ! is my nose bleeding ? you punched me . - sorry . - it' s ok . it was amazing . it was like over the top amazing . what was that , like a 3 or 4 for you ? stan ... stan ...
there' s something i have to tell you . ok , what is it ? why are you crying ? i' m pregnant . i' m pretty sure it doesn' t happen that fast . i know it ... it' s hard to explain . what are you talking about ? i' m pregnant . who' s the father ? i don' t know
i mean , i know who it is , i just don' t know his name exactly . it' s a donor of a sperm bank . seriously , what the hell are you talking about ? when did all this happened ? actually , it was the day we met . yeah , i didn' t think to tell you because i didn' t think there was any way that i could be pregnant so fast . but why ? because i wanted a baby . and i never met the right guy and i thought that if i waited any longer , i might miss my chance .
alright , we just make love and you' re telling me that your pregnant with some stranger' s child . don' t say it like that . you make it sound dirty . i wanted a baby and i thought i had to do it alone . it was before i met you . i don' t know what to say . what am i supposed to say ? congratulations , this is terrific news ? i made this big decision , this ... this thing and then i met you . i' m sorry .
about what ? getting pregnant or lying to me about it ? - i didn' t lie . - you didn' t tell the truth . where are you going ? i thought this would be easier . to just disappear at the crack of dawn ? don' t i get a say ? you said everything there was to say last night . no , i didn' t .
oh , you left out the part that you had a girlfriend , that was pretty convenient . i don' t have a girlfriend . that girl from the farmers market ? she' s not my girlfriend . she was , but was a few years ago . olivia is in my class , we study together . study what ? i' m a student . i' m still in school , i go at night . why didn' t you want to tell me ?
because it' s embarrassing . you' re this incredibly accomplished person , and i didn' t even finish college ? i mean , i have this great life but ... barely passing economics , you know . where are you going ? look , let’ s not drag this out , ok ? i lied to you , you lied to me . we both have other plans , and being together is just messing everything up . we should just go our separate ways . goodbye . so how did you two meet ?
- we can , uh , talk later in your office . - ok . well , everything seems right on track . a little blood , quite normal . stan , you have to stay here if you don' t want . i' m fine , i' m good . now , i' m going to do an ultrasound . this is how we view the future oh , i see , you rub it on her stomach . for a minute i thought you' re going to put that huge thing ...
in her vagina ? it is too early to go through the abdomen , you see . we have to go through the vagina . vagina . vagina . vagina . vagina . vagina . maybe if i say enough you' il feel a little more comfortable . - vagina .
- it' s not working . ok now zoe , with a little bit of luck , we' il see a heartbeat . that' s it ? that little thing ? is everything okay ? oh , everything is ... - what , what ? - i see another heartbeat . it has two hearts ? no , but you have two babies .
are you going to leaving now ? because this is more than you bargained for . it' s more than i bargained for . but , just tell me , ok , so ... i can be prepared . i just ... need to sit here . you know ? - okay . - okay . but then are you going to leave ?
ok , one kid is a lot , two kids is a posse . i' m just getting use to us as a couple . and now all of a sudden you' re having a posse ? are you ready for a posse ? i don' t even know if i like kids . hey ! beat it pal ! i don' t want to cause a scene , but get your hands out of your pockets and get the hell out of here . no , i' m talking to you because you' re the only pervert with his hands in his pockets at a playground . - hey , if you don' t have kids , get lost !
i have kids , ok ? a week ago i didn' t even know she was pregnant and now she' s having twins ! i just saw the ultrasound . the one that goes inside . i know what you need . how did this happen ? - take that off - this it ? - yup - oh man , i' m dizzy . i' m sweating and dizzy . - that' s normal , bro .
- is it ? - which one' s yours ? - i' ve got three . - three ? - yeah . there is charlie right there , and that' s roxy . you see the little fella over there ? that' s matt - he' s eating sand - yeah by the time you get to the third one , you don' t worry so much about that stuff .
what' s it like , the whole kid thing ? it' s great ! except for the lack of sleep , free time ... sex with my wife , butt naked friday' s in the family room ... that' s not the answer i was looking for . its fine . the best way i can describe it is ... ... it' s awful , awful , awful , awful and then something incredible happens and then awful , awful , awful , awful , awful and something incredible happens again it' s like this all day , every day i feel like i' m drowning
like i' m gasping to get my old life back and then a small moment happens ... ... that’ s so magical so life affirming that it makes it all worthwhile . this will be best thing you ever do . dada . hey , son i guess this would be that moment right ? yup , this would be it . - hey , what do you have there , son ? - poo poo well , almost .
- son , is that cat shit ? - no - that' s your shit ? - no this isn’ t even his shit . charlie , roxy , meet me at the bathroom ! what i tell you about playing with other people shit ? so , why are you upset ? it' s so lucky . to get pregnant on the first try with frozen sperm is rare but to get pregnant with twins ... ?
come on , that' s unheard of . ok , when you want to speak you can . does anyone else have anything in the mean time that they like to share ? - tabitha ? - yeah , i' m having a hard time luka keeps asking me why his friends have two parents and he only has one . i guess i knew this would happen someday - but i just wasn' t prepared ... - ok , there' s this guy , his name is stan - and he' s fantastic - wasn' t i just speaking ?
you know , whenever you meet somebody , the kind of guy who makes you rethink everything like ... maybe i can be a stay at home mom maybe i can . i love being barefoot and pregnant maybe he can teach me how to make cheese and we can live off the land zoe , this group is called single mothers and proud i know . i know . i know i' m sorry . i wasn' t planning to meet anybody .
it just ... it just happened and now i' ve thrown all my plans out the window and really ... fallen for this guy . i' m just afraid he might not stay . what should i do ? i don' t know this is wildly outside my field of expertise yeah , because we are a ... single mothers group . so don' t tend to give advice on how to get your boyfriend to commit not usually . maybe you should join a different group .
ok , we are going to have to take a vote on this zoe , because ... i think we all collectively feel you are in a very wildly different place than where we are - so we are going to take a vote . - ok hi how did you find me ? i called the store . i said it was an emergency what is it ? you' re crazy
- i don' t expect you to stay - i don' t expect you to expect me to stay what if i want to stay ? well then i would be surprised and happy . - i can' t promise anything . - neither can i. ok fine , give me the hot dog perry and hudson . feel free to run every red light . you got it . - here we go .

totally , completely . she drags it everywhere my wife , she drew eyes on hers . so when i went to make a move in the middle of the night the pillow is staring at me like ... uh uh bro ! i don' t think so . we used to have sex all time , every day ! now i can' t touch her . i can pearly go near her . dude ! she' s pregnant .
you can' t win , the one who wins is the pillow . - screw that pillow , man ! - you might have to . i did once . we' re going to be fine . we' re going to get through this . everything is going to be fine . in a year’ s time this is just going to be a funny memory , right ? that’ s right . before you know it the kids will be in school and you long for the days when a pillow was your biggest problem
it must be hard when they first go off to school little school shoes , little backpacks no , saying goodbye to the kid is easy saying goodbye to 20 grand , now that' s hard what are you talking about ? 20 grand ? what' s 20 grand ? and you will have twins . double whammy . that' s a whole lot of parmesan .

i can' t imagine she had this great laugh and really soft hands . she use to rub my back before i went to sleep such a small thing but i think about it all the time why don' t you ever talk about your dad ? she was in a coma for two years after this - he didn' t stick around - oh , god , zoe - i' m so sorry - it' s no big deal it was an important lesson for me . that' s when i realized that nothing lasts forever .
so now you know everything . some things can last forever maybe so about my exam ... i didn' t exactly ... that' s weird . i' m confused - why' d you say you' d come in the first place ? - seemed like a good idea at the time is that zoe ?

- that' s it isn' t it ? - really ? after everything we' ve been through you think i don' t want kids ? - you really think that ? - that' s what you just said it' s not what i just said , it' s what you just heard . there is a big difference ! i don' t think you' re ready for this now that it' s all happening , now that you seen a woman push a baby out now ... it' s all too real for you
- and you' re scared - damn right , i' m scared - yeah . aren' t you scared ? - you know what i' m scared of ? i' m scared that i' m going to have these babies and then you' re going to walk away you' re going to say , " they' re not mine " , and just going to walk away . every day you’ re looking for some kind of hint that i' m leaving no matter how many times i tell you that i' m not . i don' t know what else to do . what else am i supposed to do ? nothing

don' t you tell me it' s going to be ok ! you don' t know it' s going to be ok . i' m so scared ! - it is going to be ok ! - let' s try to refrain from yelling at the patients ? i' m not yelling ! i' m just try to get her to see my point ! sounds like yelling to me . what' s it going to take for you to believe that i' m here forever ? you had to see a stupid stroller ?
what about the fact i' ve been to every doctors appointment with you ? i picked out names with you i saved this from the very first day we met it' s the one that was tails up and you flipped it to heads i' ve kept it this whole time and it' s brought me the most incredible luck i can' t believe you kept that what about the fact that like it or not i' il be here holding your hand through this ? what about the fact that i' m going to be here when these babies are born ? because i love their mommy
and what i want more than anything else in this world is to be their daddy but you have to promise me that from now on you' il believe me when i say i' m in and i' m not going anywhere can you do that ? can you ? yes - okay - alright , now push . time to push . breathe , breathe remember my three rules :
no touch , no talk , and no eye contact while the dog' s nose is busy analyzing our energy and all the different scents on our body this sniffing can last from 3 seconds to 1 minute it' s important not to interrupt the dog while she' s intent on accomplishing this ritual you know , one day ... i' m going to tell you girls a story of your mommy and me . she should write a book about that one . talk about a best- seller come here that' s nice come here
it was a battle but they finally fell asleep penny had a poop ... don' t talk about penny' s poop when i' m about to kiss you . it' s perfect . you know what the best part is ? we can stop in for lunch every single day . - alright , they’ re here ! - speech ... speech ! - hey ! - okay , thank you , um , wow !
thank you all for coming this had been a dream me for a long time i need to thank one person for giving me the courage to do it - to zoe - to zoe ! from the moment you stole my cab from the day you dissede me at the farmers market i have been totally and completely under your spell i love you and you' ve made me the happiest man alive it was my cab
so , come over here for a minute - givme that - what ? since we do everything backwards and in hyper speed i was wondered if we could do what naturally follows having twins girls together holly shit ! will you marry me ? - yes - yeah ! - i can' t believe it - i know - did we really just get engaged ? - yes we did
soon you will be my wife stan ? come on ! but you realize i know nothing about politics ? - you voted for him , didn' t you ? - adam lang ? of course i did . everyone voted for him . he wasn' t a politician , he was a craze . well , there you go .
look , it' s a new ghostwriter he needs , not another goddamn politico . he was paid $10 million for these memoirs , but rumor has it the manuscript' s a crock of shit . rhinehart' s lending him his house at the ocean so they can fix it , and the pressure must have gotten to mcara . pathologist said his blood was , like , three parts booze . you mean he drowned by accident ? accident , suicide , who cares ? it was the book that killed him . well , that' s encouraging . ( chuckles dryly ) who is this mcara ?
should i have heard of him ? yeah . he was some kind of aide to lang when he was prime minister , so don' t admit that you haven' t . he was with him for years . i don' t know , rick . this is a great opportunity for you . plus the money is good . kids won' t starve . - i don' t have any kids . roy .
who' re you expecting to bomb you , random house ? we' re publishing lang' s memoirs . that' s enough to make us a target , apparently . thank you . - how many have you seen ? - five . you' re the last . i must be honest . i don' t think you' re the right man for this assignment . then it' s a good job it' s not your decision , roy .
john maddox , chief executive of rhinehart , new york . sir . sidney kroll , mr. lang' s washington attorney . mr. kroll . and nick ricardelli i believe you know . all right , rick . john : all right , i gather from rick you' re aware of the situation ? perhaps you can enlighten us and tell us what exactly you' re gonna bring to this project . nothing .
no , i' m not gonna pretend to be someone i' m not . you have my cv . his last effort was the autobiography of a magician , i came , i sawed , i conquered . yeah , and it went straight to number one , so ... after you turned it down , roy . look , i don' t read political memoirs . and i gather you' ve spent $10 million on this book . how much of that are you gonna see back ? two ?
three ? it' s bad news for your shareholders . and it' s worse news for your client , mr. kroll . adam lang , he wants a place in history , not in the remainder tables . oh , please ! it' s because i know nothing about politics that i' il ask the questions that get right to the heart of who adam lang is . and that is what sells autobiographies . heart . wow ! that' s nicely done .
- what utter balls . - you think so ? john , of course . adam lang' s a world historical figure . his autobiography is gonna be a world- publishing event . yeah , well , i got warehouses filled with world- publishing events waiting to be pulped . sid ? adam is obviously still very upset by what happened to mike mcara . he was irreplaceable . irreplaceable , and yet he has to be replaced .
adam can certainly appreciate the benefits of trying someone different . in the end , it' s about chemistry . do you work out , maybe ? - not really . - that' s a pity . adam likes to work out . actually , i know a good writer on the guardian who uses a gym . okay , maybe we could just run over the publishing schedule , yeah ? we need to wrap this up in a month . - ghost :
a month ? - yes . - you want the book in a month ? - we already have a first draft . yeah , well , it needs a lot of work . that' s why i like your resume here . you' re fast , and you deliver . you name it , he ghosts it . ( chuckles ) and you' re a brit .
the ghost should be a brit . ( imltates brltish accent ) to get the jolly old tone right , right ? ( chuckllng ) - do you have any family commitments ? - no , i have no family . why ? adam is locked into a us lecture tour , also a fundraising program for the adam lang foundation . it' s a month in the states . that' s okay . couldn' t i bring the manuscript back here to work on ?
i' m afraid not . it' s in a secure environment in marty rhinehart' s own house . only a few people are allowed to handle it . sounds more like a bomb than a book . i will need to see it myself at some point . i am supposed to be editing it . yeah , in theory . actually , we need to talk about that . - john : how soon can you get over there ?
- as soon as you want . - he' il fly tonight . - rick . ( softly ) it' s okay . okay , you' re in . oh ! - ( grunts ) congratulations . - thank you . thanks . - rick .
- thank you . actually , i have something here is that ... no , no , no , this isn' t adam' s book . no , it' s another client of mine . yeah , perhaps you can let me know what you think . sure . john : okay , if you' re gonna get that evening flight , we' d bitter talk contracts with rick here . wanna show our friend to the door ?
would you ? roy ? rlck : call you in an hour , buddy . john : remember ... ( imltates brltish accent ) heart . there' s something not quite right about this project . - what ? me , you mean ?
- obviously you . and mcara . suicide ? he didn' t strike me as the suicidal type . always nice to see you , roy . roy : good luck . oh , god . taxi drlver : thank you .
- yeah ? - rlck : congratulations ! - on what ? - on having me as your agent . yeah , i can hardly believe my luck . are you packed ? i just got mugged . shit ! are you okay ?
yeah , all they took was the manuscript that sidney kroll gave me . i don' t know . you tell me . are you hurt ? no , i' m fine . i think they must have followed me from rhinehart' s . why would they do that ? well , maybe they thought i had lang' s book . i knew this whole thing was a bad idea . you' re still okay to fly tonight , right ?
for god' s sake , rick , i' m in shock . well , here' s another shock for you . for one month' s work on a manuscript that' s already written , rhinehart inc . is willing to pay you $250 , 000 , plus expenses . window seat or aisle ? female newsreader : ... islam has issued a statement claiming responsibility . we hope to bring you more on that later in the bulletin . meanwhile , former british prime minister adam lang is back in the news tonight . according to leaked documents , mr. lang authorized the illegal use of british special forces to seize four suspected al- qaeda terrorists in pakistan and then hand them over for interrogation by the cla . the men , nasir ashraf , marwat sayed , salim khan and faruk ahmed , all british citizens , were seized in the pakistani city of peshawar five years ago .
all four were allegedly transferred out of the country to a secret location and tortured . mr. ashraf is reported to have died under interrogation . ( phone rlnglng ) such an operation would have been illegal under ... - rlck : yeah ? - where are you ? heathrow , like you . waiting for my flight to new york . can you see the news ?
the lang story ? yeah , i' m watching it now . what have you gotten me into ? i got you into a quarter of a million bucks , pal , that' s what i got you into . they' re calling my flight . i gotta go . listen , i just realized sidney kroll could have given me that manuscript deliberately so it would look like i was carrying lang' s book . why the hell would he do that ? i don' t know .
to use me as a tethered goat ? get some sleep on the plane . you' re sounding weird . ( scoffs ) " a tethered goat " . i' il call you next week . female newsreader : ... and long- term psychological trauma . in other words , torture . hello , sir . would you like a newspaper to read ? - have you got the evening standard ?
- we do , yes . thanks . thank you . stewardess : hello , madam . would you like a newspaper to read ? ( lang ordered secret kidnap ) woman : yes , please . thank you .
passport ? ruth : this is an absolute scandal ! amelia bly . ( door slammlng ) i' m adam' s assistant . adam' s in new york , unfortunately , and won' t be back until later this afternoon . ruth : actually , forget i said that , it' s bloody ridiculous ! ( door slams agaln ) ( chuckles ) oh , dear .
i' m so sorry . i' m afraid ruth' s having one of those days . if this isn' t a good time , i could go to ... no , no . she' s keen to meet you . - right . shall we make a start ? - right . - how was your journey ? - long .
amella : we' re a small team . ghost : thanks . amella : this is alice . lucy' s traveling with adam . we need another pair of hands , but adam couldn' t bring himself to replace mike . - they were together so long . - how long were you with him ?
amella : eight years . i' m an attachment from number 10 . ah . poor number 10 . before i show you the manuscript , i need you to sign this confidentiality agreement . sign here . and here . and here .
ghost : wow , quite a place . don' t you get lonely at night ? it' s my husband i miss the most . are you married ? i noticed you don' t wear a wedding ring . i can' t , sadly . it' s far too large . - it bleeps when i go through airport security . here we are .
the manuscript is not to be removed from this room . it' s not to be copied . you have six hours before adam gets in from new york . - can you finish by then ? - i' il try . i' il ask dep to bring you up a sandwich for lunch . thanks . have fun . " langs are scottish folk , originally , and proud of it . " our name is a derivation of " long " , the old english word for " tall " ,
" and it is from north of the border that my forefathers hail " . fuck . " my great- grandfather , ebenezer lang " , " was born in 1862 in pitlochry , scotland " . " one of nine children , seven of them boys " . " the american president was much taller than i had expected " . ( laughlng ) " this year' s european summit was particularly interesting " . " i always found the queen , in private , to have a delightful sense of humor " . thanks .
" i' ve always been an optimist . the present is where we live " . " ruth and i look forward to the future , whatever it may hold " . the end . as bad as that ? oh , hello . will ? how bad is it ? you haven' t read it ? not all of it .
- well , let' s just say it needs some work . - how much work ? well , all the words are there . they' re just in the wrong order . come on . you look like you need a break . you were my idea . i was ? you wrote christy costello' s memoirs , didn' t you ? you read those ?
we stayed at his house in mystique , last winter . the book was beside the bed . - i' m embarrassed . - no , why ? it was brilliant , in a horrible sort of way . how you turned his ramblings into something vaguely coherent . i said to adam , " here' s the guy to write your book , not mike " . ( slghs ) god , i miss home . it' s like being married to napoleon on st. helena . - why don' t you go back to london ?
- ruth : i don' t feel i can leave him alone . there' s something not quite right with him at the moment . amelia told me he was very upset at the death of michael mcara . oh , she did , did she ? quite when mrs. bly became the expert on my husband' s emotions , i' m not sure . losing mike was a blow , of course , but it' s not just that . it' s having to relive everything , year by year , for this bloody book . oh , dear . you must be wondering what you' ve let yourself in for .
fine , fine . i' il tell him . they' re just about to land . on thursday , he' s in chicago . actually , i think i' il go and meet him . amelia can stay here and polish her nails or something . why don' t you come , say hello ? fine . i' il travel in the backup car . i can do my nails in there .
( chuckllng ) hi , darling . - how was new york ? - short and sweet . hi , barry . hi , amelia . hello . who are you ? i' m your ghost . right .
don' t worry . he isn' t always such a jerk . this place really comes alive at night . you' il be with us for four weeks , is that right ? i' m afraid so . and the bill goes directly to the rhinehart corporation ? good . that doesn' t include the mini- bar . all right . he' s ready for you .
how' s your hotel ? quiet ? monastic . that' s nice . no distractions . thanks , love . hi , man . you ready to start ? absolutely . - ghost :
is the manuscript loaded on this ? - it is . can i have it ? amella : i' m sorry , that would be a security risk . you mean i' ve got to retype the whole manuscript ? have you really got my entire book on that little thing ? we can get 100 books on it , adam . and it can be copied in a flash . that' s the trouble .
amazing . you know the worst thing about my life ? you get so out of touch . everything' s done for you . you don' t drive , you don' t carry money . if i need cash , i have to borrow it from the protection boys . this is the kind of details we need in the memoirs . i couldn' t put that in . people would think i was a complete idiot . no , not at all .
no , this shows what it' s like being prime minister . that' s exactly what the readers want to know . how does it feel to run a country ? how does it feel to be so cut off ? how does it feel to be so hated ? thanks a lot . ( stammers ) and so loved . amelia , what do you think ? i think i should leave you two alone . so , how do we go about this ?
i interview you . i turn your answers into prose . here and there , i' il add linking passages , imitating your voice . okay . - you heard about mike ? - yes . i' m sorry . we should put in something nice about him . i think his mother would like that . of course .
well , urn , the first thing that struck me was , you became such a successful politician precisely because you didn' t appear to be a politician . it' s certainly not something i wanted to do when i was younger . i thought most student politicians were complete nerds . well , i' m with you there . so , what turned you on to politics ? turned me on , indeed . let' s see , i was 23 , something like that , a couple of years out of cambridge . and i remember it was a sunday afternoon , it was raining . i was still in bed . and someone starts knocking at the door .
and , you know , i' d been out the night before and had a few drinks and what have you . so , i get the pillow and i put it over my head , and it starts up again . knock , knock , knock , knock ! and i get up , i' m swearing , i go to the door and there' s this girl . she' s soaking wet , but she just launches into this speech about the local elections . and that' s it . - i' m in love . - and this is ruth ? this is ruth . and the only way i can see her again is to join the party and hand out leaflets .
this is great . you want to use this ? use it ? i think we should open true whole book like this . " i went into politics out of love " , " not love for a party or an ideology , but out of love for a woman " . could you transcribe this as quickly as possible , please ? of course . - thanks . - how' s it going ?
pretty well . he keeps calling me " man " . he always does that when he can' t remember someone' s name . there are sandwiches in the kitchen . ( gruntlng ) oh , shit . it' s awful . i' m sorry , sir . i didn' t realize there was anyone up there . what on earth is going on ?
it' s just a security drill , sir . we have it once a week . so , there you are . i' d rather lost track of you . i' m a big boy now . can' t keep your eye on me all the time . don' t wander around on your own . the security boys don' t like it . gotcha . - did you win ?
- didn' t play tennis . gym ? what' s he in training for ? the olympics ? here' s your transcript . cambridge . let' s talk about that . sorry ? um ... cambridge ?
it was such a long time ago , i can hardly remember . you did a lot of acting ? some . it must have been good training for politics , acting ? it was a good way to meet girls . let' s not put that in , by the way , okay ? still , acting must have been very important to you . okay , let' s say i enjoyed it . you know , you go on the stage , pretend to be somebody else , and people actually applaud you for it . good , that' s more like it .
let' s put that in . - no . - why not ? because these are the memoirs of a prime minister . and whenever my opponents were stuck with something to hit me with , they always said i was a bloody actor ! do you know what the times of london said the day i resigned ? " kindly leave the stage " . so , no , we won' t dwell , if you don' t mind , on my student days as an actor . we leave it exactly the way mike wrote it . would you like to take a break for a minute ?
actually , that would be a good idea , thank you . i need to make a call . amella : what a bastard . look at this . " former british foreign secretary richard rycart " " has asked the international criminal court in the hague to investigate allegations " " that the former british prime minister adam lang " " for torture by the cla " . ( phone rlnglng )
don' t ! the pack is on the move . unplug all the phones . is ruth still out walking ? shit ! she is , isn' t she ? - barry ! barry ! - yeah . would you please find mrs. lang and get her back here as soon as you can ?
- right . - amella : let' s go . - rycart has made a statement . - yes , i know . - he just called me . - amella : it' s unbelievable . he wanted very much to let me know it was nothing personal . he wanted very , very much to tell me that it was only because of his well- known stand on human rights that he couldn' t keep quiet any longer .
" his well- known stand on human rights " . dear god ! - sorry to lose my temper earlier . - forget it . and have you told her ? adam : yes . just called her . amella : and how did she take it ?
sorry , adam . this is running on ap . " according to sources in the hague " , " the prosecutor' s office of the international criminal court " " will issue a statement in the morning " . amella : oh , adam . thank you , alice . why weren' t we given some warning of this ? where' s downing street ?
the phones are disconnected . switch is probably trying to get through now . now ? what freaking use is now ? what are you people doing ? i mean , you' re not telling me that the cabinet office didn' t know this was coming ? the war crimes court doesn' t warn a suspect who' s under investigation . that' s what adam is now , a suspect ? you need to call sid kroll . i think we should call london first .
adam ! if it suits them , they will hang you out to dry . - you need a lawyer . call sid . - ( adam slghs ) - get sid on the line . - what about the media ? issue a holding statement , something short . this is when we need mike . i' il write something .
let him do it . he' s supposed to be the writer . - hang on a minute . - adam : i should sound confident . not defensive , that' d be fatal . but i shouldn' t be cocky . no bitterness , no anger , and don' t say " i' m pleased at this opportunity to clear my name " or any balls like that . so , you' re not defensive , but you' re not cocky .
you' re not angry , but you' re not pleased ? - adam : that' s it . - then what exactly are you ? told you he was funny . i' ve always been a passionate supporter ... no , scrub that . i' ve always been a strong , no , committed supporter of the work of the international criminal court . you' re the writer . the struggle against terror is too important to be used for the purposes of personal revenge .
very good . you could be the new mike mcara . - hello ? - john : john maddox . this is gonna be big . this can only be good for us . - could be . - here' s the first chapter right here . okay .
what' ve you covered so far ? um ... the early years , childhood , university . all right , forget that crap . get him focused on the war crimes . and he can' t talk to anybody else , all right ? - right . - it' s gotta be our exclusive . any chance of you finishing the manuscript sooner ? sooner ?
yeah , yeah , sooner . well , how much sooner ? i' m thinking two weeks . jesus . look , i know it' s tough , but if anyone can do it , you can . i' m relying on you . we' il talk . shit . i' d never have guessed you smoked . i only allow myself one at times of great stress or contentment .
- and which is this ? - very funny . maddox just called . he wants the book in two weeks instead of four . christ . good luck . yeah , i wouldn' t mind a lift back to my hotel . i could get on with some work there . you' re not planning on taking that manuscript - out of here , are you ?
- course not . because you do realize how serious this is getting , don' t you ? - you can search me , if you like . - that won' t be necessary . all right . fetch your stuff . i' il get one of the boys to take you . mr. lang insisted he had always been a committed supporter of the work of the international criminal court . mr. lang added , quote , " the struggle against terror is too important "
" to be used for the purposes of personal revenge " . - same again , sir ? - this is being widely interpreted as ... - yes , thanks . - ... an attack on the former british foreign secretary richard rycart , who has asked ... could we change the channel ? - sure . - thanks . at issue is the practice of so- called waterboarding , an interrogation technique considered a war ... ( male announcer chatterlng ) - something to eat ?
- what' ve you got ? - club sandwich . clam chowder . - chowder will be fine . man : you' re english ? ghost : and so are you . indeed i am . - you here on a holiday ?
- no , i' m working . so , what' s your line ? just this and that . excuse me . i hear adam lang' s on the island . is he ? so i hear . you don' t happen to know his whereabouts , do you ? no . no , i' m afraid not .
if you don' t mind . male announcer : raymond to naslund and to mattias ohlund . a slap pass to lukas krajicek he' s in trouble against barret jackman and the referee ... asshole . ... and ohlund can' t hold it in again , and this power play is just about over . keith tkachuk almost set to come back on . hello ? - can i help you ? - hi .
( stammerlng ) yeah , can you tell me , has anyone gone up to my room ? no , sir . - did anyone ask for me ? - no . what about that other guest ? there' s an englishman . you' re the only guest in the hotel , sir . - hello ? - amella : you need to check out of the hotel immediately .
things have changed . a can' s on its way . what ? see you then . hello ? - man : okay . - just check on that . ( war crimes court to rule on british ex- premier ) - it' s getting big , huh ?
- so i see . who' re you with ? i' m on my own . oh , sod it . here we go again . rlck : you' ve reached the office of rick ricardelli . leave a message . hi , rick . now they want the book in two weeks .
thanks for getting me this job . can' t talk . some peace protestors are trying to kill me . you' re working for a murderer ! you' re working for a murderer ! woman : liar ! liar ! - are you ill ? - no , i' m aging .
this place is shangri- la in reverse . amella : i tried to call you several times last night . you didn' t answer . ghost : i forgot to charge my mobile phone . really ? and the hotel phone ? i' m a heavy sleeper . well , you can do your heavy sleeping here from now on .
- here ? - amella : we' re under siege . you can' t run the media gauntlet every day . eventually , they' il discover who you are . and that would be horrid for you . so , this is where you put the granny . no . this is where we put mike mcara . we haven' t had a chance to clear it yet .
the sheets have been changed , though . actually , i make it a rule never to stay in a client' s house . but now you can have constant access to the manuscript . isn' t that what you want ? besides , sid kroll will be arriving any minute . why don' t you settle in , and then come up and join us ? - you' re practically one of us now . - i am ? you drafted the statement yesterday . that makes you an accomplice .
so , here' s the score . you' re not being charged , you' re not being arrested . none of this is gonna amount to a hill of beans . the only thing the prosecutor is asking for is permission to launch a formal investigation . - investigating me for what ? - connie ? either crimes against humanity or war crimes . well , that' s absurd . it' s not exactly genocide . " under article 25 , a person shall be guilty of a war crime "
" if that person facilitates the commission of such a crime " " or aids , abets or otherwise assists in its commission " . - that' s rather sweeping . - well , if it' s any comfort , you' re in no jeopardy as long as you stay here , among friends . are you saying i can' t leave the united states ? as your attorney , i strongly advise you not to travel to any country that recognizes the jurisdiction of the international criminal court . well , just about every country in the world recognizes the icc . america doesn' t . - who else ? - sldney :
josh ? iraq , china , north korea , indonesia , israel . - and that' s it ? - josh : there are some parts of africa . wait ! i wish to make a short statement . i won' t be taking questions . this morning , i was granted power to investigate the former british prime minister , mr. adam peter bennett lang , under articles 7 and 8 of the 1998 rome statute of the international criminal court . i shall shortly be contacting mr. lang and the british government to ask for their full cooperation .
oh , god . okay , we need to get you to washington , adam , right away . my plane is at the airport . we can get you in to see the speaker of the house at lunchtime and have a photo- op with the secretary of state in the afternoon . won' t it look as if i' m panicking ? no , they' il both say that the meetings were fixed weeks ago . well , what the hell are we supposed to be discussing ? sldney : alds ? poverty ?
climate change ? who cares ? the important thing is to show the world it' s business as usual . - what do you think , ruth ? - i think it' s a terrible idea . you' il look as though you' re america' s whipping boy , running crying home to daddy . - so , what would you do ? - ruth : fly to london . the government will support you .
" the british government will cooperate fully with the investigation " . really ? and what makes you think that ? i' m not thinking it , ruth , i' m reading it . ... believe we can now go live to the un in new york , where the former british foreign secretary , richard rycart , is about to make a statement . i watched the announcement in the hague today with great shock and sadness . adam lang was and is an old friend of mine . you cheeky bugger ! i regret that he' s chosen to bring this down to a personal level . this isn' t personal . this is about justice .
this is about making sure every political leader knows when they make a decision , they will be held to account by international law . thank you . male rerorter : if you' re called to testify , sir , will you go ? - rlchard : certainly , i' il go . - of course you will , you little shit ! that settles it . washington it is . ruth :
i still say it' il look bad . not as bad as being led away from heathrow in handcuffs . it would show you had some guts . well , then why the hell don' t you just fly back without me ? if the british government wants to hand me over to this kangaroo court , then sod them ! i' il go where people want me . amelia , tell the boys we' re leaving . have one of the girls pack me a bag . you' d better pack one for yourself . why don' t you share a suitcase ?
it' s so much more convenient . i' il see you tomorrow . i' m sorry to abandon you . at least this might help sales . perhaps rhinehart' s pr department organized the whole thing . well , fell them to stop it , will you ? okay , people , remember , happy , happy faces . male rerorter : so , just to summarize what we know so far , it' s now official , the special prosecutor of the international war crimes court is to launch an investigation ... ... the special prosecutor announced she was going to investigate mr. lang , well , there was a big cheer , i can tell you .
so , let' s talk to some of these protestors . - you , sir , you' re english , i believe . - yes , i am . so , what brings you so far from home ? my son . he was killed in one of mr. lang' s illegal wars . lang' s never visited the injured . he' s never apologized . i was in the british army for 30 years . it' s a disgrace !
thank you . can i ask you the same question ? ( protesters clamorlng ) you' re a murderer , lang ! you' re a war criminal ! crowd : ( chantlng ) liar , liar , liar ! woman : ( over bullhorn ) lang , lang , lang ! crowd :
killer , killer , killer ! - woman : lang , lang , lang ! - crowd : liar , liar , liar ! - woman : lang , lang , lang ! - crowd : killer , killer , killer ! male reporter 1 :
over here , mr. lang ! i apologize for keeping you waiting so long in the cold . male reporter 2 : what' s your reaction to mr. rycart' s statement ? i' d like to say a few words in response to the news from the hague . these are strange times when those who stand for freedom and justice are accused of being criminals , while those who incite hatred and seek to destroy democracy - are treated as victims , - woman : war criminal ! let me make one thing perfectly clear . while i have breath in my body , i shall fight terrorism ...
man : liar ! ... whether it' s on the battlefield or , if necessary , in the courts . thank you very much . female rerorter : have you spoken to the president , mr. lang ? oh , for god' s sake . god . shit ! one minute ! yes ?
sir ? you want lunch ? that would be great . give me five minutes , thanks . p. emmett ? rlchard : richard rycart . who is this ? - dep ? - sir ?
is there a map of the island that i could borrow ? look . it' s rain soon . i don' t know . i think it will be all right . why don' t you take the car ? it' s for guests . here' s the key . - for our guests , it' s very nice car . - oh .
yes . mr. mcara loved this car very , very much . do you know ... i' m gonna take the ... i' m gonna take the bicycle . thanks . this is ... just a moment , just a moment . it' s rain . i give ...
i give you my hat and my gloves . - that' s very kind , thank you . - good luck for you . - thank you . thank you , yeah , bye . - bye- bye . just one moment . god , you frightened me . - you' re british . - i am , yeah .
it' s okay , you can shelter . sheltering' s free . ( dog barklng ) no , no , no , no ! rosie , rosie ! in you go . in , in . here . - so , you' re british , huh ? - yeah .
- you anything to do with this fellow , lang ? - in a way , yes . seems intelligent . now why did he go and get himself mixed up with that damn fool in the white house ? well , that' s what everyone wants to know . what brings you to this part of the island ? i' m sightseeing . well , you sure picked a heck of a day for it . someone i knew was found washed up on the beach there . - you mean the british guy from the ferry ?
- that' s right . - now that was a funny business . - what do you mean ? no way should that current have carried him that far west . - no ? - no way ! are you sure ? i' ve lived here 54 years . did you mention that to the police ? the police ?
at my age , i' ve better things to do , young man . annabeth' s the one dealing with the police . your wife ? annabeth wurmbrand , mars wurmbrand' s widow . she' s the one who told them about the lights . - lights ? - the flashlights on the beach . - when ? - the night the body was washed up . could , could you , um ...
could you point me in the direction of mrs. wurmbrand' s house ? oh , sure . you just ... here . follow it down the beach there . it' s the house nearest the ocean . but she won' t talk to you . - why not ? - she' s in a coma . fell down stairs a week ago .
been in a coma ever since . ruth : come down ! come down ! dep told me you were here ! what ? i said dep told me you were here . we came to get you before the storm came . what are you doing ? - just taking the air .
- no , really . i wanted to see where mike mcara was found . why ? adam' s asked me to write something about him in the book . - where' s your bike ? - up there . barry , will you come around with the car ? we' il meet you out by the road . i can' t do that , i' m afraid , mrs. lang . have to stay with you at all times .
for god' s sake ! if we meet any terrorists , i' il text you . all right , well , stay on the path . don' t speak to anyone . we won' t talk to a soul , officer , i promise . poor mike . i can' t bear the idea of him ending up so far from home . i wonder if we' il ever know whether it was accident or suicide . can' t help you . i never met him .
i suppose it doesn' t really matter . he was drunk . he drowned . end of story . - what was he doing on the ferry ? - no idea . funeral' s on monday , in london . i' m thinking of going . one of us should put in an appearance , and it doesn' t seem likely to be my husband . i thought you didn' t want to leave him .
rather seems as though he' s left me , wouldn' t you say ? - hello ? - sorry . i did knock . it' s just me . - i brought you some dry clothes . - that' s all right . i can manage . dinner' s in an hour , okay ? fine , thanks .
for god' s sake . ghost : " it was at the time of the london elections " " that i first got to know ruth " . " she had gained a first at oxford " " and then done a year' s postgraduate research as a fulbright scholar " . ruth . - perfect fit . now all you need is a drink . - what are we having ?
biodynamic white wine from the rhinehart vinery in the napa valley . rhinehart . he doesn' t own a distillery , i suppose ? mm . evening news . female newsreader : ... for war crimes . our political editor has more . christ , we' re the lead story . pour us some more wine , will you ? i may have to get drunk for a change .
male newsreader : in washington , mr. lang received firm promises of support , both from congressional leaders and the secretary of state , before going on to a private dinner tonight with the vice president . adam lang has stood by america' s side in the war against terror , and i' m proud to stand by his side this afternoon . - adam , good to see you . - adam : thank you . thank you very much , indeed . it' s good to see you . don' t grin . male newsreader :
in iraq , a suicide bomber ... for god' s sake ! adam . oiling to find out how i think it went . - let him sweat . - does he always ask for your advice ? yes , and always usually takes it . until lately . - are you married ? - certainly not .
- gay ? - no . - did you have a ... - i had a ... um ... - what ? girlfriend ? - well , a bit more than that . partner ? a bit less than that .
i don' t know , 40 , 000 years of human language and there' s no word to describe our relationship . it was doomed . come on . let' s eat . - how' s it going ? - the book ? - well , it' s not , to be honest . - sit there . - can i ask you something ? - of course .
i find it difficult to understand certain things . - what things ? - well ... i can' t understand why this good- looking lad who goes to cambridge without the slightest interest in politics and who spends his time acting and chasing girls , - suddenly ends up ... - married to me ? oh , no , not that . no , not that , at all . no , what i don' t get is why , at 22 , he' s suddenly a political activist . - i mean , where does that come from ?
- didn' t you ask him ? he said he joined the party because of you . told me a great story about you turning up at his place in the rain . - i was gonna start the whole book with it , - and now you' re not ? no , i can' t . it' s not true . - isn' t it ? - well , you know it' s not . he' d been a member for two years before he met you . how do you know that ?
i' ve got a copy off his original party membership card . mike mcara found it in the archives . typical mike , to ruin a good story with too much research . did he find anything else ? not much . cambridge stuff mainly . you were more political than he was . i was certainly a change from his cambridge girlfriends . all those jocastas and pandoras . and so his marriage to you must have been pretty vital , your knowledge and your contacts in the party .
and i thought he married me for my body . did you ever want to be a proper politician in your own right ? of course . didn' t you want to be a proper writer ? ouch . i' m sorry . i' ve hurt your feelings . i suppose even ghosts must have feelings . we are sensitive spirits . talking of spirits , could you ...
let me get you a proper drink . white wine , never really seen the point of it . that' s the sort of thing mike used to say . ah ! at last , something in common . do you know the coroner reckoned he' d drunk nearly half a bottle ? that' s convenient . - what do you mean ? - nothing . - you think his death was suspicious ?
- don' t you ? yes . yes , i do . today at the beach , i met a man , an old timer who was familiar with the currents . and he said that there was no way that a body from the ferry could have washed ashore on that spot . you' re kidding . he also said that there was a woman who saw flashlights on the beach that night . and then she fell down the stairs , and now she' s in a coma . that' s all i know .
that' s all you know ? jesus . - can i borrow your phone ? i need to call adam . - what ? - nothing . - aren' t you gonna call him ? - later . i' m going out for a walk . but it' s pitch black .
it' s pouring with rain . - it' il clear my head . - well , i' il come with you . no . thanks , but i need to work this one through on my own . stay here . have another drink . don' t wait up . are you awake ? - well , i am now .
- i' m sorry . it' s all right . hang on . - what time is it ? - i don' t know . i called adam . - and ? - can i come in ? the day before mike died , he and adam had a terrible row . i' ve never told anyone this before , not even the police .
- what about ? - i don' t know . but it was furious . they never spoke again . when i asked adam about it , he refused to discuss it . after what you just said , i felt i should ask him again . and what did he say ? he was having dinner with the vice president . that bloody bly woman wouldn' t even give him the phone . ( sobblng ) oh , god .
oh , dear god . what' s he got himself mixed up in ? it' s all right . everything ' !! be all right . i' m scared . i' ve never been scared in my life before , but i am now . your hair' s all wet , you' re drenched . let me get you a towel . ( softly ) bad idea . do you mind ?
course not . the modesty of the morning after ? i' m sorry . i thought you were asleep . you mean you thought i' d be gone ? you' ve taken out the family tree . he' s very proud of the langs . you know , if you want a family tree , go to a garden center . why have you underlined my name every time ? i was surprised there wasn' t more about you .
why ? i' m just the wife . yeah , even so . you ought not to be written out of history . why not ? most women are . then i' il reinstate you . i' il put in all the occasions that he' s forgotten . how kind . like the boss' s secretary that remembers his wife' s birthday for him ?
something like that . but then , like you say , i' m not a proper writer . - what are you planning to do ? - leave . it' s not necessary , as far as i' m concerned . i' m afraid it is , as far as i am . - where will you go ? - back to the hotel . look , i' m sorry . i should never have stayed in a client' s house .
- it always ends up with ... - with you screwing the client' s wife ? no , not always . but it does make it hard to maintain a professional distance . and the thing we discussed last night ? what do you propose to do about that ? - that' s none of my business . - well , you can' t just ignore it look , i' m his ghostwriter . i' m not an investigative reporter .
- what are you gonna do about it ? - perhaps i' il write my own memoirs . ex- prime minister' s wife tells all . well , if you ever decide to do that , give me a call . you think i need someone like you to produce my book ? i don' t want to be in his bloody memoirs . he' s on his own . i' il get a divorce . and she can do the prison visits . morning , sir .
- finished for the night , have we ? - why don' t you just piss off ?

" professor paul emmett of harvard university " " has written of the unique importance of the english- speaking peoples " " in the spread of democracy around the world " . " as these nations stand together " , " whenever they have faltered , tyranny has gathered strength " . nancy : hello ?
- is that mrs. emmett ? - who is this ? i wondered if i might have a word with professor emmett . do you have an appointment ? it' s about adam lang . i' m assisting him with his memoirs . just a moment , please . raul : this is raul emmett . i think you must have made a mistake .
but you were at cambridge with mr. lang ? we were contemporaries , yes , but i can' t claim to know him . i have a photograph of you together . come on up to the house . i make it a rule never to see anyone without an appointment . but your mention of a photograph rather tickled my curiosity . - please , come in . - thank you . yes , he' s here now . - may i ?
- sure . nancy : yes . yes , he' s on his own . he didn' t say . british , about 40 . well , well . i literally have no recollection of this . - but that is you ? - yes , it is .
i was on the board of the dramat . i had quite a time of it , as you can imagine . - the dramat ? - i' m sorry . the yale dramatic association . i maintained my theatrical interests when i went to cambridge for my doctoral research . - could i keep this ? - no , i' m afraid not . - i' m sure i could get you a copy . - would you ?
that would be kind . maybe you could tell me how you came by it . i' d be happy to . come into my study . yes , the wall of ego . we all have one . it' s our equivalent of the dentist' s fish tank . have a seat . so , the picture . um ...
i' ve been working with adam lang on his memoirs . yes , i know , you told me . yes , poor lang . it' s bad business , this posturing by the hague . as for rycart , the worst british foreign secretary since the war . lang was right to fire him . - how well do you know lang ? - hardly at all . - you seem surprised . - he mentions you in his memoirs .
oh , really ? well , now it' s my turn to be surprised . what does he say ? that' s very decent of him . as prime minister , he always had good instincts . - but that doesn' t mean i know him . - but the ... that ... that was taken at a reception in london to mark the 10- year anniversary of the arcadia . - arcadia ?
- yeah , it' s a little organization that i ran . very highbrow . no reason why you should have heard of it . the prime minister graced us with his presence . what can you remember of him from cambridge ? - i' m sorry , you don' t mind , do you ? - no , not at all . go ahead . it' s just that i' m rather bewildered . no one' s mentioned the cambridge connection between us in all these years .
- but you performed together ? - in one production . it was the summer revue . i can' t even remember what it was called . - can i show you something else ? - if you must . oh , my . ( chuckllng ) is that what i think it is ? let' s hope he didn' t inhale .
but that is you standing behind him , isn' t it ? i do believe it is . and i do believe i' m on the point of issuing a stern warning to him on the perils of drug abuse . is mr. lang really going to use these pictures in his memoirs ? if so , i would prefer it if i weren' t named . my children would be mortified . they' re so much more puritanical than we were . - can you tell me about any of the others ? - no , i' m afraid not . the whole summer is a blur , a very happy blur .
now , you were going to tell me about these pictures . i got them from michael mcara . and he is whom , exactly ? my predecessor on lang' s memoirs . - he resigned ? - no , he died . i' m sorry to hear that . yes , a couple of weeks ago . he drove up here to see you . and he died a few hours afterwards .
he drove up to see me ? no , i' m afraid you' re mistaken . - how did he die ? - he drowned . poor fellow . i' ve never really believed the myth that death by drowning is painless , have you ? seems to me it must be agonizing . and the police never said anything to you about this ? i' ve had no contact with the police . but were you here that weekend ?
this would have been january , the 11th and 12th . a less equable man than i might start to find your questions impertinent . nancy ? nancy ? our visitor wishes to know where we were on the 11th and 12th of january . do we possess that information ? that was the colorado weekend . yes , of course , the aspen institute . bipolar relationships in a multi- polar world . - sounds fun .
- yes , it was . i was the main speaker . look , just to return to cambridge . no , if you don' t mind , let' s not return to cambridge . i' ve said all i have to say on that subject . i' m an avid reader of political memoirs . i' il get hold of mr. lang' s when they appear . perhaps he' il send you a copy , for old time' s sake . i doubt that very much . the gate will open automatically .

- how much for a room ? - for you , $89 . - i' il pay cash . - who' s got your card ? the nanny ? rlchard : you rang back . are you going to stay on the line this time ? yes . i' ve been trying to call you .
i know , i' m sorry ... it didn' t seem right , speaking to you . who are you ? i' m the new ghostwriter ... no names , don' t use any names . how did you get this number ? it was in my predecessor' s effects . the ... the thing is , i' m in trouble . is it because of your client ?
yeah . there' s something wrong , but i didn' t know who to talk to . where are you ? without being too specific . on the island ? i' m in the ... no , i' m on the mainland , on the ... this motel by the ferry . room number ? 201 .
- have you got the book with you ? - yeah . okay . stay there . hatherton ? man : with $35 billion of funds at its disposal , the hatherton group brings together a family of companies devoted to defense and security . and with unrivaled expertise in the middle east , including the services of two former presidents , three prime ministers and two directors of the cla , hatherton is proud to stand at the forefront of the struggle against terror . hatherton , a shelter from harm .
" according to cla whistleblower frank molinari " , " yale graduate paul emmett " " was reported to have joined the agency as an officer in 1971 " , it' s 1974 . - hello ? - ruth : you' re alive . yeah , just about . i' ve been worried sick . the police called to say they' d found the car on the ferry .
again ! i' m so sorry . i parked it , and then , and then i got off the boat . what the hell were you doing on the mainland , anyway ? - i drove to new york . - why ? i needed to see john maddox . and where are you now ? i' m still at the ferry terminal , i missed the last crossing . you really are bloody hopeless !
i just had adam on the phone , trying to get hold of you . he' s flying back tonight . he sounds in a right state . you didn' t tell him about us , did you ? god' s sake , ruth ! i' ve got to go . i' il call you back . - who is it ? - mr. rycart sent me . hold on .
just gonna do a quick check , if you don' t mind . get your stuff together . we' re leaving . hey ! that' s private ! - he' s clean . - rlchard : thanks , frank . sorry about that . please , get in .
- you thought it was a trap ? - it crossed my mind . you do work for lang . yeah , for three days . i hardly know the guy . who does ? i worked for him for 15 years , till he fired me , and i still can' t fathom him . yeah , his wife said more or less the same . there you go . if someone as sharp as ruth can' t get him , what hope do we have ?
- tough day ? - yeah , you could say that . you have the book ? frank : yeah . he' s got it . before we go any further , i wonder if i might take a look at that book . no . before we go any further , there' s a few things i' d like to know first . such as , why did mike mcara have your number ?
okay . sure . he was helping me . mcara ? how ? mike found the documents linking lang to the torture flights . what ? it was mcara who gave you the documents ? - yeah , mike mcara . the loyalest of the loyal .
- but why ? he didn' t like discovering he was working for a war criminal . would you ? oh , i forgot . you are . the book ? well , don' t tell me you' re gonna read it now . not all of it . just the beginning . there' s something very important about it .
yeah . it' s the cure for insomnia . there you go , guys . can i get you anything else ? no , thanks , love . mike said he' d discovered something new . it' s the last time he called me . he said it explained everything that had gone wrong when we were in govern merit - what was it ? - he wouldn' t say over the phone .
he just kept saying if anything happened to him , the truth was in lang' s memoirs . " it' s all there in the beginning " . the beginning ? then he means cambridge . what the hell' s this ? that is lang , and that is paul emmett . emmett ? the arcadia guy . so what ? on the day that mike mcara died , he drove up to see emmett , and i think he was murdered on his way home .
- what ? - i went to see emmett today , and two guys followed me from his house . that' s why i called you . at the time that this photograph was taken , paul emmett was an officer in the cla . emmett ? - foreign resources division . - oh , my god . you realize how important this is , don' t you ? this explains why lang went into politics .
everyone knows he didn' t have a political thought in his pretty little head . this is why he rose so quickly , with a little help from his friends . - well , do you think it' s possible ... - okay , a quiz for you . name one decision lang made in 10 years as prime minister which wasn' t in the interests of the usa . well , come on , it' s not a trick question . iraq , middle east policy , star wars defense , buying american nuclear missiles , support of terrorist rendition . the sacking of any minister washington didn' t like , including yours truly . mcara was right . this explains everything .
it' s amelia bly . answer it . - hello , amelia . - good evening . i have adam for you . ( softly ) lang . adam : we' re coming to get you . what ? ruth tells me you' re stuck at the ferry terminal .
we' ve just taken off from new york pilot says we can stop by and pick you up . really ? there' s no need . we' ve got a book to write , remember ? hold on a sec , adam . ( softly ) he said he wants to pick me up in his private jet . - say yes . - what if it' s a trap ? if you refuse , he' il get suspicious .
tell him yes . that' d be great , adam . yeah , thanks . i' il get to the airport . see you there . he sounds worried . i really don' t think this is a good idea . you have no choice . emmett must have told lang that i' d been to see him . so , what' s he gonna do about it ?
dump you in the ocean ? - well , it happened before ! - which means it can' t happen again . he can' t drown two ghostwriters , for god' s sake . you' re not kittens . all this is just theory . we don' t have any proof . - you' il get us the proof . - me ? you' re his ghostwriter .
presumably , he lets you tape him . - i use discs , actually . - discs , tapes . you' ve got to confront him with this . record his reaction . even if he denies it , it' s something . i' m in a tricky position here . i signed a confidentiality agreement . it' s a bit late for that . - it means the discs are his property .
- the court can subpoena them . and what if i don' t record any discs ? then you' il be subpoenaed and forced to repeat this whole story . then i' il deny it . then i' il give them this . frank is recording every word . aren' t you , frank ? oh ! come on ! don' t look so shocked .
what did you expect ? that i' d come into a meeting with a man working for lang without taking any precautions ? except you' re not working for lang anymore . you' re working for the good guys . you know all this is pointless , don' t you ? in the end , he' il just retire over here with his cla pension , and he' il tell you and the bloody war crimes court to go and fuck yourselves . good evening , sir . hatherton welcomes you aboard . thank you . it' s my first time in a private jet .
well , let' s hope it' s not your last . hi , man . - take your seat . - thanks . - hey , bring my ghost a calvados . - yes , sir . do you mind ? leave it off for now . ruth said you were in new york to see maddox . - that' s right .
- how was he ? he was fine . full of energy ? - you know john . - yes , i do know john . as a matter of fact , i was just with him . you never saw him today , did you ? no . do you have something to tell me ? i went to see emmett .
( laughlng ) that windbag ! why ? i know about you and emmett . - me and emmett ? - i know that he was your ... - my ? - ... handler , if that' s what they' re called . - my handler ? - yeah , that he was your handler in the cla . oh , my god . you' re serious , aren' t you ?
when mcara found this , he went to boston to show it to emmett , and he died on the way home , and i think he was murdered . i think you' ve had a few too many of those already . it was mcara who believed that emmett told you to go into politics in the first place . - emmett ? i barely knew the man . - and that story of yours about why you joined the party and ruth and the canvassing , well , the dates don' t fit . i got the dates wrong . big deal ! then when he found this photograph , and he heard the rumors about emmett being in the cla ... - rumors ?
- it' s on the internet . i' ve never heard such utter balls in my entire life . mike would never have believed such crap . he was too clever . too loyal . mike betrayed you to rycart . - how do you know that ? - he told me . rycart ? he' s lying .
this phone number on the back of the photograph , it' s rycart' s . the handwriting , that' s mcara' s . mike . - mike , mike . - and you knew he was disillusioned . you had a big row with him just before he died . yes , i know , but he never mentioned this . this is just ... this is grotesque . i' ve never taken orders from anyone .
whatever i did , i did because i believed it was right . what , even supporting illegal kidnapping for torture ? oh , for god' s sake , spare me the bleeding- heart bullshit ! do you know what i' d do if i was in power again ? i' d have two queues at airports . one for flights where we' d done no background checks , infringed on no one' s civil bloody liberties , used no intelligence gained by torture . and on the other flight , we' d do everything we possibly could to make it perfectly safe . and then we' d see which plane the rycarts of this world would put their bloody kids on ! ( shoutlng ) and you can put that in the book ! man :
go home ! woman : go home ! man : here comes the killer ! woman : prosecute for torture ! female reporter : over here , mr. lang ! mr. lang !
mr. lang , will you live in america ? mr. lang , will you take american citizenship ? when we get back to the house , we need to have a meeting . - ruth : oh , my god ! - murderer ! bodyguard : firing from the roof ! ruth : let me go to him !
no ! no ! move , move , move ! fbi agent 1 : how long had you known mr. lang ? - couple of days . - in what capacity ? i was his ghost . his ghostwriter . do you recognize this man ?
he was one of the protestors . his son was killed in iraq . did you ever speak with him ? he was in the bar one night in the hotel where i was staying . fbi agent 2 : but did you speak with him ? he asked me if i knew where adam lang was staying on the island . - i told him that i didn' t . - did you report this conversation ? sorry ?
did you report this conversation to mr. lang' s protection team ? no . what was mr. lang' s demeanor this evening ? he was ... he was fine . he seemed fine . one witness said she thought she heard mr. lang shouting at you . no . - we' re gonna need your passport . a serious crime was just committed in us territory , and you' re the key witness .
we need to keep you close . male rerorter : like a fallen soldier , adam lang went home today , home to a shocked and grieving nation . not just his family , but friends and political opponents joined in tribute . a great colleague and a true patriot . we had our disagreements , but we always stayed friends . my heart goes out to ruth and the family . and i would like to say adam will be ... ( swltches tv off ) who is it ? rlck :
congratulations ! on what now ? still having me as your agent . hmm ? they don' t need you anymore . you' re free to go . - you ready to get back to work ? - i don' t think i can , rick . - i' m sorry . not after all this .
- don' t be a jerk . this is a hot book now . it' s adam lang' s voice from the grave . - the guy , he' s a hero . - i just want to go home . you can . go . go home . and finish the book from london , i don' t know , rick .
here we are . oh , here we are . i' m sorry . i think i' m over it , and then suddenly i realize i' m not . - are you sure this is all right ? - of course . my invitation said plus one . only i wondered if you might' ve wanted to bring your husband . that didn' t work out . i hadn' t appreciated quite how bored he was with being my plus one .
- shall we go in ? - yeah . - amelia bly , plus one . - thank you . that was a bit of a turn- up , for the books , you calling me . i heard you weren' t invited , and i thought you should be here . ghosts are never invited to the launch party , as a rule . we' re an embarrassment . like a mistress at a wedding . sorry .
i brought you a present . thank you . ( memoirs by adam lang ) ( chuckles ) that' s very funny . i thought , seeing as you were so keen to hold on it . you might like it as a souvenir . between you and me , it wasn' t us , it was the americans . they thought the book was a potential threat to national security . but there' s nothing in it . something about the beginnings .
i think that' s what i heard . - the beginning ? - no , beginnings . the beginnings . beginnings ? you all right ? do you know that man ? the one who' s speaking to ruth . - paul emmett ? - what' s he doing here ?
well , he was ruth' s tutor at harvard when she was a fulbright scholar . why shouldn' t he be here ? do you mind if i have that back a second ? waltress : madam ? woman : no , thank you . " langs are scottish folk , originally " . " wife and child in tow , i decided to ... " " i decided to settle " .
man : ladies and gentlemen , if i could have your attention , please . thank you . i' d like to ask ruth lang to say a few words . i miss adam all the time . but never more than tonight . not just ' cause we' re meeting to launch his wonderful new book and he should be here to share the joy of his life story with us , but because he was so brilliant at making speeches and i' m so terrible . " langs are scottish folk " . " wife and child , langs are scottish " . " wife , langs .
lang' s wife " . " lang' s " " wife ruth " " was recruited " " as a cla agent " " by professor paul emmett of harvard university " . ruth : well , you' il be relieved to hear i' m not making a speech this evening . i just want to thank our wonderful publishers , marty rhinehart and john maddox , and our attorney and friend , sidney kroll . and finally , but especially , mike mcara . mike , our thoughts are with you . in these very difficult few months , i' ve drawn great comfort from this book , from knowing that , despite the terrible double tragedy of losing both of them ,
mike and adam did at least live long enough to complete it . and i really believe that , as people read these pages , adam' s voice will keep on coming through for generations to come , eloquent , strong and full of hope . thanks to his words , he is with us still . if i' ve left out anyone' s name , i hope you' il forgive me . but now i must make a toast . to the memory of a great man ( ruth lang ) and a great patriot , a wonderful husband and a devoted father . to adam ! all : to adam !
you were marvelous . man : would you ... this one looks nasty . yeah , it' s just happened just now . yeah , if you could . " the ghost writer " come on ! but you realize i know nothing about politics ? - you voted for him , didn' t you ?
- adam lang ? of course i did . everyone voted for him . he wasn' t a politician , he was a craze . well , there you go . look , it' s a new ghostwriter he needs , not another goddamn politico . he was paid $10 million for these memoirs , but rumor has it the manuscript' s a crock of shit . rhinehart' s lending him his house at the ocean so they can fix it , and the pressure must have gotten to mcara . pathologist said his blood was , like , three parts booze . you mean he drowned by accident ?
accident , suicide , who cares ? it was the book that killed him . well , that' s encouraging . who is this mcara ? should i have heard of him ? yeah . he was some kind of aide to lang when he was prime minister , so don' t admit that you haven' t . he was with him for years . i don' t know , rick . this is a great opportunity for you .
plus the money is good . kids won' t starve . - i don' t have any kids . - i do . roy . who' re you expecting to bomb you , random house ? we' re publishing lang' s memoirs . that' s enough to make us a target , apparently . thank you . - how many have you seen ?
- five . you' re the last . i must be honest . i don' t think you' re the right man for this assignment . then it' s a good job it' s not your decision , roy . john maddox , chief executive of rhinehart , new york . sir . sidney kroll , mr. lang' s washington attorney . mr. kroll . and nick ricardelli i believe you know .
all right , rick . all right , i gather from rick you' re aware of the situation ? perhaps you can enlighten us and tell us what exactly you' re gonna bring to this project . nothing . no , i' m not gonna pretend to be someone i' m not . you have my cv . his last effort was the autobiography of a magician , i came , i sawed , i conquered . yeah , and it went straight to number one , so ... after you turned it down , roy .
look , i don' t read politicai memoirs . who does ? and i gather you' ve spent $10 million on this book . how much of that are you gonna see back ? two ? three ? it' s bad news for your shareholders . and it' s worse news for your client , mr. kroll . adam lang , he wants a place in history , not in the remainder tables . oh , please !
it' s because i know nothing about politics that i' il ask the questions that get right to the heart of who adam lang is . and that is what sells autobiographies . heart . wow ! that' s nicely done . - what utter balls . - you think so ? john , of course . adam lang' s a world historicai figure . his autobiography is gonna be a world- publishing event .
yeah , well , i got warehouses filled with world- publishing events waiting to be pulped . sid ? adam is obviously still very upset by what happened to mike mcara . he was irreplaceable . irreplaceable , and yet he has to be replaced . adam can certainly appreciate the benefits of trying someone different . in the end , it' s about chemistry . do you work out , maybe ? - not really . - that' s a pity .
adam likes to work out . actually , i know a good writer on the guardian who uses a gym . okay , maybe we could just run over the publishing schedule , yeah ? we need to wrap this up in a month . a month ? - yes . - you want the book in a month ? - we already have a first draft . yeah , well , it needs a lot of work . that' s why i like your résumé here .
you' re fast , and you deliver . you name it , he ghosts it . and you' re a brit . the ghost should be a brit . to get the jolly old tone right , right ? - do you have any family commitments ? - no , i have no family . why ? adam is locked into a us lecture tour , also a fundraising program for the adam lang foundation . it' s a month in the states .
that' s okay . couldn' t i bring the manuscript back here to work on ? i' m afraid not . it' s in a secure environment in marty rhinehart' s own house . only a few people are allowed to handle it . sounds more like a bomb than a book . i will need to see it myself at some point . i am supposed to be editing it . yeah , in theory . actually , we need to talk about that .
how soon can you get over there ? - as soon as you want . - he' il fly tonight . - rick . it' s okay . okay , you' re in . - congratulations . - thank you . thanks . - rick .
- thank you . actually , i have something here no , no , no , this isn' t adam' s book . no , it' s another client of mine . yeah , perhaps you can let me know what you think . sure . okay , if you' re gonna get that evening flight , we' d better talk contracts with rick here . wanna show our friend to the door ? would you ? roy ?
call you in an hour , buddy . hey ! remember ... heart . there' s something not quite right about this project . - what ? me , you mean ? - obviously you . and mcara . suicide ?
he didn' t strike me as the suicidai type . always nice to see you , roy . good luck . oh , god . thank you . - yeah ? congratulations ! - on what ? - on having me as your agent . yeah , i can hardly believe my luck .
are you packed ? i just got mugged . shit ! are you okay ? yeah , all they took was the manuscript that sidney kroll gave me . what ? why ? i don' t know . you tell me . are you hurt ?
no , i' m fine . i think they must have followed me from rhinehart' s . why would they do that ? well , maybe they thought i had lang' s book . i knew this whole thing was a bad idea . you' re still okay to fly tonight , right ? for god' s sake , rick , i' m in shock . well , here' s another shock for you . for one month' s work on a manuscript that' s already written , rhinehart inc . is willing to pay you $250, 000 , plus expenses .
window seat or aisle ? ... islam has issued a statement claiming responsibility . we hope to bring you more on that later in the bulletin . meanwhile , former british prime minister adam lang is back in the news tonight . according to leaked documents , mr. lang authorized the illegai use of british speciai forces to seize four suspected al- qaeda terrorists in pakistan and then hand them over for interrogation by the cla . the men , nasir ashraf , marwat sayed , salim khan and faruk ahmed , all british citizens , were seized in the pakistani city of peshawar five years ago . all four were allegedly transferred out of the country to a secret location and tortured . mr. ashraf is reported to have died under interrogation . such an operation would have been illegai under ... yeah ? - where are you ?
heathrow , like you . waiting for my flight to new york . can you see the news ? the lang story ? yeah , i' m watching it now . what have you gotten me into ? i got you into a quarter of a million bucks , pal , that' s what i got you into . they' re calling my flight . i gotta go . listen , i just realized
sidney kroll could have given me that manuscript deliberately so it would look like i was carrying lang' s book . why the hell would he do that ? i don' t know . to use me as a tethered goat ? get some sleep on the plane . you' re sounding weird . " a tethered goat . " i' il call you next week . ... and long- term psychologicai trauma . in other words , torture . hello , sir . would you like a newspaper to read ?
- have you got the evening standard ? - we do , yes . thanks . thank you . hello , madam . would you like a newspaper to read ? yes , please . thank you . passport ? this is an absolute scandal !
amelia bly . welcome . i' m adam' s assistant . adam' s in new york , unfortunately , and won' t be back untii later this afternoon . actually , forget i said that , it' s bloody ridiculous ! oh , dear . i' m so sorry . i' m afraid ruth' s having one of those days . if this isn' t a good time , i could go to ... no , no .
she' s keen to meet you . - right . shall we make a start ? - right . - how was your journey ? - long . we' re a small team . thanks . this is alice . lucy' s traveling with adam .
we need another pair of hands , but adam couldn' t bring himself to replace mike . - they were together so long . - how long were you with him ? eight years . i' m an attachment from number 10 . ah . poor number 10 . before i show you the manuscript , i need you to sign this confidentiality agreement . sign here .
and here . and here . wow , quite a place . don' t you get lonely at night ? it' s my husband i miss the most . are you married ? i noticed you don' t wear a wedding ring . i can' t , sadly . it' s far too large . - it bleeps when i go through airport security .
- oh . here we are . the manuscript is not to be removed from this room . it' s not to be copied . you have six hours before adam gets in from new york . - can you finish by then ? - i' il try . i' il ask dep to bring you up a sandwich for lunch . thanks . have fun .
" langs are scottish folk , originally , and proud of it . " our name is a derivation of ' long , ' the old english word for ' tall , ' " and it is from north of the border that my forefathers hail . " fuck . " my great- grandfather , ebenezer lang , " was born in 1862 in pitlochry , scotland . " one of nine children , seven of them boys . " " the american president was much taller than i had expected . " " this year' s european summit was particularly interesting . " " i always found the queen , in private , to have a delightfui sense of humor . "
thanks . " i' ve always been an optimist . the present is where we live . " ruth and i look forward to the future , whatever it may hold . " as bad as that ? oh , hello . well ? how bad is it ? you haven' t read it ? not all of it .
- well , let' s just say it needs some work . - how much work ? well , all the words are there . they' re just in the wrong order . come on . you look like you need a break . you were my idea . i was ? you wrote christy costello' s memoirs , didn' t you ? you read those ?
we stayed at his house in mustique , last winter . the book was beside the bed . - i' m embarrassed . - no , why ? it was brilliant , in a horrible sort of way . how you turned his ramblings into something vaguely coherent . i said to adam , " here' s the guy to write your book , not mike . " god , i miss home . it' s like being married to napoleon on st. helena . - why don' t you go back to london ?
i don' t feei i can leave him alone . there' s something not quite right with him at the moment . amelia told me he was very upset at the death of michaei mcara . oh , she did , did she ? quite when mrs. bly became the expert on my husband' s emotions , i' m not sure . losing mike was a blow , of course , but it' s not just that . it' s having to relive everything , year by year , for this bloody book . oh , dear . you must be wondering what you' ve let yourself in for . fine , fine .
i' il tell him . they' re just about to land . on thursday , he' s in chicago . actually , i think i' il go and meet him . amelia can stay here and polish her nails or something . why don' t you come , say hello ? fine . i' il travei in the backup car . i can do my nails in there . hi , darling .
- how was new york ? - short and sweet . hi , barry . hi , amelia . hello . who are you ? i' m your ghost . right . don' t worry . he isn' t always such a jerk .
this place really comes alive at night . you' il be with us for four weeks , is that right ? i' m afraid so . and the bill goes directly to the rhinehart corporation ? good . that doesn' t include the mini- bar . all right . he' s ready for you . how' s your hotel ? quiet ?
monastic . that' s nice . no distractions . thanks , love . hi , man . you ready to start ? absolutely . is the manuscript loaded on this ? - it is . can i have it ?
i' m sorry , that would be a security risk . you mean i' ve got to retype the whole manuscript ? have you really got my entire book on that little thing ? we can get 100 books on it , adam . and it can be copied in a flash . that' s the trouble . amazing . you know the worst thing about my life ? you get so out of touch . everything' s done for you .
you don' t drive , you don' t carry money . if i need cash , i have to borrow it from the protection boys . this is the kind of details we need in the memoirs . i couldn' t put that in . people would think i was a complete idiot . no , not at all . no , this shows what it' s like being prime minister . that' s exactly what the readers want to know . how does it feei to run a country ? how does it feei to be so cut off ?
how does it feei to be so hated ? thanks a lot . and so loved . amelia , what do you think ? i think i should leave you two alone . so , how do we go about this ? i interview you . i turn your answers into prose . here and there , i' il add linking passages , imitating your voice . okay .
- you heard about mike ? - yes . i' m sorry . we should put in something nice about him . i think his mother would like that . of course . well , um , the first thing that struck me was , you became such a successfui politician precisely because you didn' t appear to be a politician . it' s certainly not something i wanted to do when i was younger . i thought most student politicians were complete nerds . well , i' m with you there .
so , what turned you on to politics ? turned me on , indeed . let' s see , i was 23 , something like that , a couple of years out of cambridge . and i remember it was a sunday afternoon , it was raining . i was still in bed . and someone starts knocking at the door . and , you know , i' d been out the night before and had a few drinks and what have you . so , i get the pillow and i put it over my head , and it starts up again . knock , knock , knock , knock ! and i get up , i' m swearing , i go to the door and there' s this girl .
she' s soaking wet , but she just launches into this speech about the locai elections . and that' s it . - i' m in love . - and this is ruth ? this is ruth . and the only way i can see her again is to join the party and hand out leaflets . this is great . you want to use this ? use it ? i think we should open the whole book like this .
" i went into politics out of love , " not love for a party or an ideology , but out of love for a woman . " could you transcribe this as quickly as possible , please ? of course . - thanks . - how' s it going ? pretty well . he keeps calling me " man . " he always does that when he can' t remember someone' s name . there are sandwiches in the kitchen .
oh , shit . it' s awful . i' m sorry , sir . i didn' t realize there was anyone up there . what on earth is going on ? it' s just a security drill , sir . we have it once a week . so , there you are . i' d rather lost track of you . i' m a big boy now .
can' t keep your eye on me all the time . don' t wander around on your own . the security boys don' t like it . gotcha . - did you win ? - didn' t play tennis . gym . gym ? what' s he in training for ? the olympics ?
here' s your transcript . cambridge . let' s talk about that . sorry ? um ... cambridge ? it was such a long time ago , i can hardly remember . you did a lot of acting ? some . it must have been good training for politics , acting ?
it was a good way to meet girls . let' s not put that in , by the way , okay ? still , acting must have been very important to you . okay , let' s say i enjoyed it . you know , you go on the stage , pretend to be somebody else , and people actually applaud you for it . good , that' s more like it . let' s put that in . - no . - why not ? because these are the memoirs of a prime minister .
and whenever my opponents were stuck with something to hit me with , they always said i was a bloody actor ! do you know what the times of london said the day i resigned ? " kindly leave the stage . " so , no , we won' t dwell , if you don' t mind , on my student days as an actor . we leave it exactly the way mike wrote it . would you like to take a break for a minute ? actually , that would be a good idea , thank you . i need to make a call . what a bastard . look at this .
" former british foreign secretary richard rycart " has asked the internationai criminai court in the hague to investigate allegations " that the former british prime minister adam lang " for torture by the cla . " don' t ! the pack is on the move . unplug all the phones . is ruth still out walking ? shit ! she is , isn' t she ?
- barry ! barry ! - yeah . would you please find mrs. lang and get her back here as soon as you can ? - right . let' s go . - rycart has made a statement . - yes , i know . - he just called me . it' s unbelievable .
he wanted very much to let me know it was nothing personal . he wanted very , very much to tell me that it was only because of his well- known stand on human rights that he couldn' t keep quiet any longer . " his well- known stand on human rights . " dear god ! - sorry to lose my temper earlier . - forget it . and have you told her ? yes . just called her . and how did she take it ? sorry , adam .
this is running on ap . " according to sources in the hague , " the prosecutor' s office of the internationai criminai court " will issue a statement in the morning . " oh , adam . thank you , alice . why weren' t we given some warning of this ? where' s downing street ? the phones are disconnected . switch is probably trying to get through now .
now ? what freaking use is now ? what are you people doing ? i mean , you' re not telling me that the cabinet office didn' t know this was coming ? the war crimes court doesn' t warn a suspect who' s under investigation . that' s what adam is now , a suspect ? you need to call sid kroll . i think we should call london first . adam ! if it suits them , they will hang you out to dry .
you need a lawyer . call sid . - get sid on the line . - what about the media ? issue a holding statement , something short . this is when we need mike . i' il write something . let him do it . he' s supposed to be the writer . - hang on a minute .
i should sound confident . not defensive , that' d be fatal . but i shouldn' t be cocky . no bitterness , no anger , and don' t say i' m pleased at this opportunity to clear my name or any balls like that . so , you' re not defensive , but you' re not cocky . you' re not angry , but you' re not pleased ? that' s it . - then what exactly are you ? told you he was funny .
i' ve always been a passionate supporter ... no , scrub that . i' ve always been a strong , no , committed supporter of the work of the internationai criminai court . you' re the writer . the struggle against terror is too important to be used for the purposes of personai revenge . very good . you could be the new mike mcara . - hello ? john maddox . this is gonna be big .
this can only be good for us . - could be . - here' s the first chapter right here . okay . what' ve you covered so far ? um ... the early years , childhood , university . all right , forget that crap . get him focused on the war crimes . and he can' t talk to anybody else , all right ?
- right . - it' s gotta be our exclusive . any chance of you finishing the manuscript sooner ? sooner ? yeah , yeah , sooner . well , how much sooner ? i' m thinking two weeks . jesus . look , i know it' s tough , but if anyone can do it , you can . i' m relying on you .
we' il talk . shit . i' d never have guessed you smoked . i only allow myself one at times of great stress or contentment . - and which is this ? - very funny . maddox just called . he wants the book in two weeks instead of four . christ . good luck .
yeah , i wouldn' t mind a lift back to my hotel . i could get on with some work there . you' re not planning on taking that manuscript - out of here , are you ? - course not . because you do realize how serious this is getting , don' t you ? - you can search me , if you like . - that won' t be necessary . all right . fetch your stuff .
i' il get one of the boys to take you . mr. lang insisted he had always been a committed supporter of the work of the internationai criminai court . mr. lang added , quote , " the struggle against terror is too important " to be used for the purposes of personai revenge . " - same again , sir ? - this is being widely interpreted as ... - yes , thanks . - ... an attack on the former british foreign secretary richard rycart , who has asked ... could we change the channel ?
- sure . - thanks . at issue is the practice of so- called waterboarding , an interrogation technique considered a war ... - something to eat ? - what' ve you got ? - club sandwich . clam chowder . - chowder will be fine . you' re english ? and so are you .
indeed i am . - you here on a holiday ? - no , i' m working . so , what' s your line ? just this and that . excuse me . i hear adam lang' s on the island . is he ? so i hear . you don' t happen to know his whereabouts , do you ?
no . no , i' m afraid not . if you don' t mind . raymond to naslund and to mattias ohlund . a slap pass to lukas krajicek . he' s in trouble against barret jackman and the referee ... asshole . ... and ohlund can' t hold it in again , and this power play is just about over . keith tkachuk almost set to come back on . hello ?
- can i help you ? - hi . yeah , can you tell me , has anyone gone up to my room ? no , sir . - did anyone ask for me ? - no . what about that other guest ? the , um ... there' s an englishman . you' re the only guest in the hotel , sir .
- hello ? you need to check out of the hotei immediately . things have changed . a car is on its way . what ? see you then . hello ? okay . - just check on that . okay ?
- it' s getting big , huh ? - so i see . who' re you with ? i' m on my own . oh , sod it . here we go again . you' ve reached the office of rick ricardelli . leave a message . hi , rick . now they want the book in two weeks .
thanks for getting me this job . can' t talk . some peace protestors are trying to kill me . you' re working for a murderer ! you' re working for a murderer ! liar ! liar ! liar ! - are you ill ? - no , i' m aging .
this place is shangri- la in reverse . i tried to call you severai times last night . you didn' t answer . i forgot to charge my mobile phone . really ? and the hotei phone ? i' m a heavy sleeper . well , you can do your heavy sleeping here from now on . - here ? we' re under siege .
you can' t run the media gauntlet every day . eventually , they' il discover who you are . and that would be horrid for you . so , this is where you put the granny . no . this is where we put mike mcara . we haven' t had a chance to clear it yet . the sheets have been changed , though . actually , i make it a rule never to stay in a client' s house . but now you can have constant access to the manuscript .
isn' t that what you want ? besides , sid kroll will be arriving any minute . why don' t you settle in , and then come up and join us ? - you' re practically one of us now . - i am ? you drafted the statement yesterday . that makes you an accomplice . so , here' s the score . you' re not being charged , you' re not being arrested . none of this is gonna amount to a hill of beans .
the only thing the prosecutor is asking for is permission to launch a formai investigation . - investigating me for what ? - connie ? either crimes against humanity or war crimes . well , that' s absurd . it' s not exactly genocide . " under article 25 , a person shall be guilty of a war crime " if that person facilitates the commission of such a crime " or aids , abets or otherwise assists in its commission . " - that' s rather sweeping .
- well , if it' s any comfort , you' re in no jeopardy as long as you stay here , among friends . are you saying i can' t leave the united states ? as your attorney , i strongly advise you not to travei to any country that recognizes the jurisdiction of the internationai criminai court . well , just about every country in the world recognizes the icc . america doesn' t . - who else ? josh ? iraq , china , north korea , indonesia , israel . - and that' s it ? there are some parts of africa .
wait ! i wish to make a short statement . i won' t be taking questions . this morning , i was granted power to investigate the former british prime minister , mr. adam peter bennett lang , under articles 7 and 8 of the 1998 rome statute of the internationai criminai court . i shall shortly be contacting mr. lang and the british government to ask for their full cooperation . oh , god . okay , we need to get you to washington , adam , right away . my plane is at the airport . we can get you in to see the speaker of the house at lunchtime and have a photo- op with the secretary of state in the afternoon . won' t it look as if i' m panicking ?
no , they' il both say that the meetings were fixed weeks ago . well , what the hell are we supposed to be discussing ? alds ? poverty ? climate change ? who cares ? the important thing is to show the world it' s business as usual . - what do you think , ruth ? - i think it' s a terrible idea . you' ii look as though you' re america' s whipping boy , running crying home to daddy .
- so , what would you do ? fly to london . the government will support you . " the british government will cooperate fully with the investigation . " really ? and what makes you think that ? i' m not thinking it , ruth , i' m reading it . ... believe we can now go live to the un in new york , where the former british foreign secretary , richard rycart , is about to make a statement . i watched the announcement in the hague today with great shock and sadness . adam lang was and is an old friend of mine . you cheeky bugger !
i regret that he' s chosen to bring this down to a personai level . this isn' t personal . this is about justice . this is about making sure every politicai leader knows when they make a decision , they will be held to account by internationai law . thank you . if you' re called to testify , sir , will you go ? certainly , i' il go . - of course you will , you little shit ! that settles it . washington it is .
i still say it' ii look bad . not as bad as being led away from heathrow in handcuffs . it would show you had some guts . well , then why the hell don' t you just fly back without me ? if the british government wants to hand me over to this kangaroo court , then sod them ! i' il go where people want me . amelia , tell the boys we' re leaving . have one of the girls pack me a bag . you' d better pack one for yourself . why don' t you share a suitcase ?
it' s so much more convenient . i' il see you tomorrow . i' m sorry to abandon you . at least this might help sales . perhaps rhinehart' s pr department organized the whole thing . well , tell them to stop it , will you ? okay , people , remember , happy , happy faces . so , just to summarize what we know so far , it' s now official , the speciai prosecutor of the internationai war crimes court is to launch an investigation ... ... the speciai prosecutor announced she was going to investigate mr. lang , well , there was a big cheer , i can tell you . so , let' s talk to some of these protestors .
- you , sir , you' re english , i believe . - i am . so , what brings you so far from home ? my son . he was killed in one of mr. lang' s illegai wars . lang' s never visited the injured . he' s never apologized . i was in the british army for 30 years . it' s a disgrace ! thank you .
can i ask you the same question ? you' re a murderer , lang ! you' re a war criminal ! liar , liar , liar ! lang , lang , lang ! killer , killer , killer ! lang , lang , lang ! liar , liar , liar ! lang , lang , lang ! killer , killer , killer !
over here , mr. lang ! i apologize for keeping you waiting so long in the cold . what' s your reaction to mr. rycart' s statement ? i' d like to say a few words in response to the news from the hague . these are strange times when those who stand for freedom and justice are accused of being criminals , while those who incite hatred and seek to destroy democracy - are treated as victims . war criminal ! let me make one thing perfectly clear . while i have breath in my body , i shall fight terrorism ... liar ! ... whether it' s on the battlefield or , if necessary , in the courts .
thank you very much . have you spoken to the president , mr. lang ? oh , for god' s sake . god . shit ! one minute ! yes ? sir ? you want lunch ? that would be great .
give me five minutes , thanks . p. emmett ? richard rycart . who is this ? - dep ? - sir ? is there a map of the island that i could borrow ? look . it' s rain soon . i don' t know .
i think it will be all right . why don' t you take the car ? it' s for guests . here' s the key . - for our guests , it' s very nice car . - oh . yes . mr. mcara loved this car very , very much . do you know ... i' m gonna take the ...
i' m gonna take the bicycle . thanks . this is ... just a moment , just a moment . it' s rain . i give ... i give you my hat and my gloves . - that' s very kind , thank you . - good luck for you . - thank you .
thank you , yeah , bye . - bye- bye . just one moment . god , you frightened me . - you' re british . - i am , yeah . it' s okay , you can shelter . sheltering' s free . no , no , no , no ! rosie , rosie !
in you go . in , in . here . - so , you' re british , huh ? - yeah . - you anything to do with this fellow , lang ? - in a way , yes . seems intelligent . now why did he go and get himself mixed up with that damn fooi in the white house ? well , that' s what everyone wants to know .
what brings you to this part of the island ? i' m sightseeing . well , you sure picked a heck of a day for it . someone i knew was found washed up on the beach there . - you mean the british guy from the ferry ? - that' s right . - now that was a funny business . - what do you mean ? no way should that current have carried him that far west . - no ?
- no way ! are you sure ? i' ve lived here 54 years . did you mention that to the police ? the police ? at my age , i' ve better things to do , young man . annabeth' s the one dealing with the police . your wife ? annabeth wurmbrand , mars wurmbrand' s widow . she' s the one who told them about the lights .
- lights ? - the flashlights on the beach . - when ? - the night the body was washed up . could , could you , um ... could you point me in the direction of mrs. wurmbrand' s house ? oh , sure . you just ... here . follow it down the beach there .
it' s the house nearest the ocean . but she won' t talk to you . - why not ? - she' s in a coma . fell down stairs a week ago . been in a coma ever since . come down ! come down ! dep told me you were here ! what ?
i said dep told me you were here . we came to get you before the storm came . what are you doing ? - just taking the air . - no , really . i wanted to see where mike mcara was found . why ? adam' s asked me to write something about him in the book . - where' s your bike ? - up there .
barry , will you come around with the car ? we' il meet you out by the road . i can' t do that , i' m afraid , mrs. lang . have to stay with you at all times . for god' s sake ! if we meet any terrorists , i' il text you . all right , well , stay on the path . don' t speak to anyone . we won' t talk to a soul , officer , i promise . poor mike .
i can' t bear the idea of him ending up so far from home . i wonder if we' il ever know whether it was accident or suicide . can' t help you . i never met him . i suppose it doesn' t really matter . he was drunk . he drowned . end of story . - what was he doing on the ferry ? - no idea .
funeral' s on monday , in london . i' m thinking of going . one of us should put in an appearance , and it doesn' t seem likely to be my husband . i thought you didn' t want to leave him . rather seems as though he' s left me , wouldn' t you say ? - hello ? - sorry . i did knock . it' s just me . - i brought you some dry clothes .
- that' s all right . i can manage . dinner' s in an hour , okay ? fine , thanks . for god' s sake . " it was at the time of the london elections " that i first got to know ruth . " she had gained a first at oxford " and then done a year' s postgraduate research as a fulbright scholar . " ruth .
- perfect fit . now all you need is a drink . - what are we having ? biodynamic white wine from the rhinehart vinery in the napa valley . rhinehart . he doesn' t own a distillery , i suppose ? mmm . evening news . ... for war crimes . our politicai editor has more .
christ , we' re the lead story . pour us some more wine , will you ? i may have to get drunk for a change . in washington , mr. lang received firm promises of support , both from congressionai leaders and the secretary of state , before going on to a private dinner tonight with the vice president . adam lang has stood by america' s side in the war against terror , and i' m proud to stand by his side this afternoon . - adam , good to see you . thank you . thank you very much , indeed . it' s good to see you . don' t grin .
in iraq , a suicide bomber ... for god' s sake ! adam . calling to find out how i think it went . - let him sweat . - does he always ask for your advice ? yes , and always usually takes it . untii lately . - are you married ? - certainly not .
- gay ? - no . - did you have a ... - i had a ... um ... - what ? girlfriend ? - well , a bit more than that . partner ? a bit less than that .
i don' t know , 40, 000 years of human language and there' s no word to describe our relationship . it was doomed . come on . let' s eat . - how' s it going ? - the book ? - well , it' s not , to be honest . - sit there . - can i ask you something ? - of course .
i find it difficult to understand certain things . - what things ? - well ... i can' t understand why this good- looking lad who goes to cambridge without the slightest interest in politics and who spends his time acting and chasing girls , - suddenly ends up ... - married to me ? oh , no , not that . no , not that , at all . no , what i don' t get is why , at 22 , he' s suddenly a politicai activist . - i mean , where does that come from ?
- didn' t you ask him ? he said he joined the party because of you . told me a great story about you turning up at his place in the rain . - i was gonna start the whole book with it . - and now you' re not ? no , i can' t . it' s not true . - isn' t it ? - well , you know it' s not . he' d been a member for two years before he met you .
how do you know that ? i' ve got a copy of his originai party membership card . mike mcara found it in the archives . typicai mike , to ruin a good story with too much research . did he find anything else ? not much . cambridge stuff mainly . you were more politicai than he was . i was certainly a change from his cambridge girlfriends . all those jocastas and pandoras .
and so his marriage to you must have been pretty vital , your knowledge and your contacts in the party . and i thought he married me for my body . did you ever want to be a proper politician in your own right ? of course . didn' t you want to be a proper writer ? ouch . i' m sorry . i' ve hurt your feelings . i suppose even ghosts must have feelings . we are sensitive spirits .
talking of spirits , could you ... let me get you a proper drink . white wine , never really seen the point of it . that' s the sort of thing mike used to say . ah ! at last , something in common . do you know the coroner reckoned he' d drunk nearly half a bottle ? that' s convenient . - what do you mean ? - nothing .
- you think his death was suspicious ? - don' t you ? yes . yes , i do . today at the beach , i met a man , an old timer who was familiar with the currents . and he said that there was no way that a body from the ferry could have washed ashore on that spot . you' re kidding . he also said that there was a woman who saw flashlights on the beach that night . and then she fell down the stairs , and now she' s in a coma .
that' s all i know . that' s all you know ? jesus . - can i borrow your phone ? - why ? i need to call adam . - what ? - nothing . - aren' t you gonna call him ? - later .
i' m going out for a walk . but it' s pitch black . it' s pouring with rain . - it' il clear my head . - well , i' il come with you . no . thanks , but i need to work this one through on my own . stay here . have another drink . don' t wait up .
are you awake ? - well , i am now . - i' m sorry . it' s all right . hang on . - what time is it ? - i don' t know . i called adam . - and ? - can i come in ?
the day before mike died , he and adam had a terrible row . i' ve never told anyone this before , not even the police . - what about ? - i don' t know . but it was furious . they never spoke again . when i asked adam about it , he refused to discuss it . after what you just said , i felt i should ask him again . and what did he say ? he was having dinner with the vice president .
that bloody bly woman wouldn' t even give him the phone . oh , god . oh , dear god . what' s he got himself mixed up in ? it' s all right . everything' il be all right . i' m scared . i' ve never been scared in my life before , but i am now . your hair' s all wet , you' re drenched . let me get you a towel .
bad idea . do you mind ? course not . the modesty of the morning after ? i' m sorry . i thought you were asleep . you mean you thought i' d be gone ? you' ve taken out the family tree . he' s very proud of the langs . you know , if you want a family tree , go to a garden center .
why have you underlined my name every time ? i was surprised there wasn' t more about you . why ? i' m just the wife . yeah , even so . you ought not to be written out of history . why not ? most women are . then i' il reinstate you . i' il put in all the occasions that he' s forgotten .
how kind . like the boss' s secretary that remembers his wife' s birthday for him ? something like that . but then , like you say , i' m not a proper writer . - what are you planning to do ? - leave . it' s not necessary , as far as i' m concerned . i' m afraid it is , as far as i am . - where will you go ? - back to the hotel .
look , i' m sorry . i should never have stayed in a client' s house . - it always ends up with ... - with you screwing the client' s wife ? no , not always . but it does make it hard to maintain a professionai distance . and the thing we discussed last night ? what do you propose to do about that ? - that' s none of my business . - well , you can' t just ignore it .
look , i' m his ghostwriter . i' m not an investigative reporter . - what are you gonna do about it ? - perhaps i' il write my own memoirs . ex- prime minister' s wife tells ail . well , if you ever decide to do that , give me a call . you think i need someone like you to produce my book ? i don' t want to be in his bloody memoirs . he' s on his own . i' il get a divorce .
and she can do the prison visits . morning , sir . - finished for the night , have we ? - why don' t you just piss off ? bmw connecteddrive . traffic is clear to your destination . join the road when possible . in 200 yards , turn left . sorry , lady , but the hotei is right . turn around when possible .
this is getting ridiculous . turn around when possible . all right , you win . in 50 yards , turn left . turn left . you' ve got to be joking . single or return ? return . i hope . forty bucks , please .
- have a good one . - ta . okay , come on . come on , keep coming . a little more . stop . in 50 yards , turn left . please proceed to the indicated road . in 200 yards , take the next exit . in half a mile , make a sharp right turn .
turn left . in 200 yards , you will have reached your destination . you have reached your destination . paui emmett ? professor paui emmett ? " professor paui emmett of harvard university " has written of the unique importance of the english- speaking peoples " in the spread of democracy around the world . " as these nations stand together , " whenever they have faltered , tyranny has gathered strength . "
hello ? - is that mrs. emmett ? - who is this ? i wondered if i might have a word with professor emmett . do you have an appointment ? it' s about adam lang . i' m assisting him with his memoirs . just a moment , please . this is paui emmett . i think you must have made a mistake .
but you were at cambridge with mr. lang ? we were contemporaries , yes , but i can' t claim to know him . i have a photograph of you together . come on up to the house . i make it a rule never to see anyone without an appointment . but your mention of a photograph rather tickled my curiosity . - please , come in . - thank you . yes , he' s here now . - may i ?
- sure . yes . yes , he' s on his own . he didn' t say . british , about 40 . well , well . i literally have no recollection of this . - but that is you ? - yes , it is . i was on the board of the dramat .
i had quite a time of it , as you can imagine . - the dramat ? - i' m sorry . the yale dramatic association . i maintained my theatricai interests when i went to cambridge for my doctorai research . - could i keep this ? - no , i' m afraid not . - i' m sure i could get you a copy . - would you ? that would be kind .
maybe you could tell me how you came by it . i' d be happy to . come into my study . yes , the wall of ego . we all have one . it' s our equivalent of the dentist' s fish tank . have a seat . so , the picture . um ... i' ve been working with adam lang on his memoirs .
yes , i know , you told me . yes , poor lang . it' s bad business , this posturing by the hague . as for rycart , the worst british foreign secretary since the war . lang was right to fire him . - how well do you know lang ? - hardly at all . - you seem surprised . - he mentions you in his memoirs . oh , really ?
well , now it' s my turn to be surprised . what does he say ? that' s very decent of him . as prime minister , he always had good instincts . - but that doesn' t mean i know him . - but the ... that . that was taken at a reception in london to mark the 10- year anniversary of the arcadia . - arcadia ? - yeah , it' s a little organization that i ran .
very highbrow . no reason why you should have heard of it . the prime minister graced us with his presence . what can you remember of him from cambridge ? - i' m sorry , you don' t mind , do you ? - no , not at all . go ahead . it' s just that i' m rather bewildered . no one' s mentioned the cambridge connection between us in all these years . - but you performed together ?
- in one production . it was the summer revue . i can' t even remember what it was called . - can i show you something else ? - if you must . oh , my . is that what i think it is ? let' s hope he didn' t inhale . but that is you standing behind him , isn' t it ? i do believe it is .
and i do believe i' m on the point of issuing a stern warning to him on the perils of drug abuse . is mr. lang really going to use these pictures in his memoirs ? if so , i would prefer it if i weren' t named . my children would be mortified . they' re so much more puritanicai than we were . - can you tell me about any of the others ? - no , i' m afraid not . the whole summer is a blur , a very happy blur . now , you were going to tell me about these pictures . i got them from michaei mcara .
and he is whom , exactly ? my predecessor on lang' s memoirs . - he resigned ? - no , he died . i' m sorry to hear that . yes , a couple of weeks ago . he drove up here to see you . and he died a few hours afterwards . he drove up to see me ? no , i' m afraid you' re mistaken .
- how did he die ? - he drowned . poor fellow . i' ve never really believed the myth that death by drowning is painless , have you ? seems to me it must be agonizing . and the police never said anything to you about this ? i' ve had no contact with the police . but were you here that weekend ? this would have been january , the 11th and 12th . a less equable man than i might start to find your questions impertinent .
nancy ? nancy ? our visitor wishes to know where we were on the 11th and 12th of january . do we possess that information ? that was the colorado weekend . yes , of course , the aspen institute . bipolar relationships in a multi- polar world . - sounds fun . - yes , it was . i was the main speaker .
look , just to return to cambridge ... no , if you don' t mind , let' s not return to cambridge . i' ve said all i have to say on that subject . i' m an avid reader of politicai memoirs . i' il get hold of mr. lang' s when they appear . perhaps he' il send you a copy , for old time' s sake . i doubt that very much . the gate will open automatically . be sure to make a right when you get to the end of the drive . if you turn left , the road will take you deeper into the woods and you may never be seen again .
when is the last ferry ? - you' re just in time . - here , i' ve got a return . all right . ticket ? - uh ... - okay . - okay . shit . hey , you !
stop ! don' t do that ! where you going ? shit ! you' ve reached the office of rick ricardelli . leave a message . piss off . what can i do for you , sir ? you wouldn' t happen to know if there are any flights leaving the airport tonight , would you ? not unless you' ve got your own private jet .
i lent it to my butler . you brits ! there' s a flight to boston - 8 : 30 tomorrow morning . - shit ! - how much for a room ? - for you , $89 . - i' il pay cash . - who' s got your card ? the nanny ?
you rang back . are you going to stay on the line this time ? yes . i' ve been trying to call you . i know , i' m sorry ... it didn' t seem right , speaking to you . who are you ? i' m the new ghostwriter ... no names , don' t use any names . how did you get this number ?
it was in my predecessor' s effects . the ... the thing is , i' m in trouble . is it because of your client ? yeah . there' s something wrong , but i didn' t know who to talk to . where are you ? without being too specific . on the island ? i' m in the ...
no , i' m on the mainland , on the ... this motei by the ferry . room number ? 201 . - have you got the book with you ? - yeah . okay . stay there . hatherton ? with $35 billion of funds at its disposal , the hatherton group brings together a family of companies devoted to defense and security .
and with unrivaled expertise in the middle east , including the services of two former presidents , three prime ministers and two directors of the cla , hatherton is proud to stand at the forefront of the struggle against terror . hatherton , a shelter from harm . " according to cla whistleblower frank molinari , " yale graduate paui emmett " was reported to have joined the agency as an officer in 1971 , it' s 1974 . - hello ? you' re alive . yeah , just about .
i' ve been worried sick . the police called to say they' d found the car on the ferry . again ! i' m so sorry . i parked it , and then , and then i got off the boat . what the hell were you doing on the mainland , anyway ? - i drove to new york . - why ? i needed to see john maddox . and where are you now ?
i' m still at the ferry terminal . i missed the last crossing . you really are bloody hopeless ! i just had adam on the phone , trying to get hold of you . he' s flying back tonight . he sounds in a right state . you didn' t tell him about us , did you ? god' s sake , ruth ! i' ve got to go . i' il call you back .
- who is it ? - mr. rycart sent me . hold on . just gonna do a quick check , if you don' t mind . get your stuff together . we' re leaving . hey ! that' s private ! - he' s clean . thanks , frank .
sorry about that . please , get in . - you thought it was a trap ? - it crossed my mind . you do work for lang . yeah , for three days . i hardly know the guy . who does ? i worked for him for 15 years , till he fired me , and i still can' t fathom him . yeah , his wife said more or less the same .
there you go . if someone as sharp as ruth can' t get him , what hope do we have ? - tough day ? - yeah , you could say that . you have the book ? yeah . he' s got it . before we go any further , i wonder if i might take a look at that book . no . before we go any further , there' s a few things i' d like to know first .
such as , why did mike mcara have your number ? okay . sure . he was helping me . mcara ? how ? mike found the documents linking lang to the torture flights . what ? it was mcara who gave you the documents ? - yeah , mike mcara .
the loyalest of the loyal . - but why ? he didn' t like discovering he was working for a war criminal . would you ? oh , i forgot . you are . the book ? well , don' t tell me you' re gonna read it now . not all of it . just the beginning .
there' s something very important about it . yeah . it' s the cure for insomnia . there you go , guys . can i get you anything else ? no , thanks , love . mike said he' d discovered something new . it' s the last time he called me . he said it explained everything that had gone wrong when we were in government . - what was it ?
- he wouldn' t say over the phone . he just kept saying if anything happened to him , the truth was in lang' s memoirs . " it' s all there in the beginning . " the beginning ? then he means cambridge . what the hell' s this ? that is lang , and that is paui emmett . emmett ? the arcadia guy . so what ?
on the day that mike mcara died , he drove up to see emmett , and i think he was murdered on his way home . - what ? - i went to see emmett today , and two guys followed me from his house . that' s why i called you . at the time that this photograph was taken , paui emmett was an officer in the cla . emmett ? - foreign resources division . - oh , my god . you realize how important this is , don' t you ?
this explains why lang went into politics . everyone knows he didn' t have a politicai thought in his pretty little head . this is why he rose so quickly , with a little help from his friends . - well , do you think it' s possible ... - okay , a quiz for you . name one decision lang made in 10 years as prime minister which wasn' t in the interests of the usa . well , come on , it' s not a trick question . iraq , middle east policy , star wars defense , buying american nuclear missiles , support of terrorist rendition . the sacking of any minister washington didn' t like , including yours truly . mcara was right .
this explains everything . it' s amelia bly . answer it . - hello , amelia . - good evening . i have adam for you . lang . we' re coming to get you . what ? ruth tells me you' re stuck at the ferry terminal .
we' ve just taken off from new york . pilot says we can stop by and pick you up . really ? there' s no need . we' ve got a book to write , remember ? hold on a sec , adam . he said he wants to pick me up in his private jet . - say yes . - what if it' s a trap ? if you refuse , he' il get suspicious .
tell him yes . that' d be great , adam . yeah , thanks . i' il get to the airport . see you there . he sounds worried . i really don' t think this is a good idea . you have no choice . emmett must have told lang that i' d been to see him . so , what' s he gonna do about it ?
dump you in the ocean ? - well , it happened before ! - which means it can' t happen again . he can' t drown two ghostwriters , for god' s sake . you' re not kittens . all this is just theory . we don' t have any proof . - you' il get us the proof . - me ? you' re his ghostwriter .
presumably , he lets you tape him . - i use discs , actually . - discs , tapes . you' ve got to confront him with this . record his reaction . even if he denies it , it' s something . i' m in a tricky position here . i signed a confidentiality agreement . it' s a bit late for that . - it means the discs are his property .
- the court can subpoena them . and what if i don' t record any discs ? then you' il be subpoenaed and forced to repeat this whole story . then i' il deny it . then i' il give them this . frank is recording every word . aren' t you , frank ? oh ! come on ! don' t look so shocked .
what did you expect ? that i' d come into a meeting with a man working for lang without taking any precautions ? except you' re not working for lang anymore . you' re working for the good guys . you know all this is pointless , don' t you ? in the end , he' il just retire over here with his cla pension , and he' il tell you and the bloody war crimes court to go and fuck yourselves . good evening , sir . hatherton welcomes you aboard . thank you . it' s my first time in a private jet .
well , let' s hope it' s not your last . hi , man . - take your seat . - thanks . - hey , bring my ghost a calvados . - yes , sir . do you mind ? leave it off for now . ruth said you were in new york to see maddox . - that' s right .
- how was he ? he was fine . full of energy ? - you know john . - yes , i do know john . as a matter of fact , i was just with him . you never saw him today , did you ? no . do you have something to tell me ? i went to see emmett .
that windbag ! why ? i know about you and emmett . - me and emmett ? - i know that he was your ... - my ? - ... handler , if that' s what they' re called . - my handler ? - yeah , that he was your handler in the cla . oh , my god . you' re serious , aren' t you ?
when mcara found this , he went to boston to show it to emmett , and he died on the way home , and i think he was murdered . i think you' ve had a few too many of those already . it was mcara who believed that emmett told you to go into politics in the first place . - emmett ? i barely knew the man . - and that story of yours about why you joined the party and ruth and the canvassing , well , the dates don' t fit . i got the dates wrong . big deal ! then when he found this photograph , and he heard the rumors about emmett being in the cla ... - rumors ?
- it' s on the internet . i' ve never heard such utter balls in my entire life . mike would never have believed such crap . he was too clever . too loyal . mike betrayed you to rycart . - how do you know that ? - he told me . rycart ? he' s iying .
this phone number on the back of the photograph , it' s rycart' s . the handwriting , that' s mcara' s . mike . - mike , mike . - and you knew he was disillusioned . you had a big row with him just before he died . yes , i know , but he never mentioned this . this is just ... this is grotesque . i' ve never taken orders from anyone .
whatever i did , i did because i believed it was right . what , even supporting illegai kidnapping for torture ? oh , for god' s sake , spare me the bleeding- heart bullshit ! do you know what i' d do if i was in power again ? i' d have two queues at airports . one for flights where we' d done no background checks , infringed on no one' s civii bloody liberties , used no intelligence gained by torture . and on the other flight , we' d do everything we possibly could to make it perfectly safe . and then we' d see which plane the rycarts of this world would put their bloody kids on ! and you can put that in the book ! go home !
go home ! here comes the killer ! prosecute for torture ! over here , mr. lang ! mr. lang ! mr. lang , will you live in america ? mr. lang , will you take american citizenship ? when we get back to the house , we need to have a meeting . oh , my god ! - murderer !
firing from the roof ! let me go to him ! no ! no ! move , move , move ! how long had you known mr. lang ? - couple of days . - in what capacity ? i was his ghost . his ghostwriter .
do you recognize this man ? he was one of the protestors . his son was killed in iraq . did you ever speak with him ? he was in the bar one night in the hotei where i was staying . but did you speak with him ? he asked me if i knew where adam lang was staying on the island . - i told him that i didn' t . - did you report this conversation ? sorry ?
did you report this conversation to mr. lang' s protection team ? no . what was mr. lang' s demeanor this evening ? he was ... he was fine . he seemed fine . one witness said she thought she heard mr. lang shouting at you . no . - we' re gonna need your passport . a serious crime was just committed in us territory , and you' re the key witness .
we need to keep you close . like a fallen soldier , adam lang went home today , home to a shocked and grieving nation . not just his family , but friends and politicai opponents joined in tribute . a great colleague and a true patriot . we had our disagreements , but we always stayed friends . my heart goes out to ruth and the family . and i would like to say adam will be ... who is it ? congratulations ! on what now ?
still having me as your agent . hmm ? they don' t need you anymore . you' re free to go . - you ready to get back to work ? - i don' t think i can , rick . - i' m sorry . not after all this . - don' t be a jerk . this is a hot book now .
it' s adam lang' s voice from the grave . - the guy , he' s a hero . - i just want to go home . you can . go . go home . and finish the book from london . i don' t know , rick . here we are . oh , here we are .
i' m sorry . i think i' m over it , and then suddenly i realize i' m not . - are you sure this is all right ? - of course . my invitation said plus one . only i wondered if you might' ve wanted to bring your husband . that didn' t work out . i hadn' t appreciated quite how bored he was with being my plus one . - shall we go in ? - yeah .
- amelia bly , plus one . - thank you . that was a bit of a turn- up , for the books , you calling me . i heard you weren' t invited , and i thought you should be here . ghosts are never invited to the launch party , as a rule . we' re an embarrassment . like a mistress at a wedding . sorry . i brought you a present . thank you .
that' s very funny . i thought , seeing as you were so keen to hold onto it , you might like it as a souvenir . between you and me , it wasn' t us , it was the americans . they thought the book was a potentiai threat to nationai security . but there' s nothing in it . something about the beginnings . i think that' s what i heard . - the beginning ? - no , beginnings . the beginnings .
beginnings ? you all right ? do you know that man ? the one who' s speaking to ruth . - paui emmett ? - what' s he doing here ? well , he was ruth' s tutor at harvard when she was a fulbright scholar . why shouldn' t he be here ? do you mind if i have that back a second ? madam ?
no , thank you . " langs are scottish folk , originally . " " wife and child in tow , i decided to ... " i decided to settle . " ladies and gentlemen , if i could have your attention , please . thank you . i' d like to ask ruth lang to say a few words . i miss adam all the time . but never more than tonight . not just ' cause we' re meeting to launch his wonderfui new book and he should be here to share the joy of his life story with us , but because he was so brilliant at making speeches and i' m so terrible .
" langs are scottish folk . " " wife and child , langs are scottish . " " wife , langs . lang' s wife . " " lang' s " wife ruth " was recruited " as a cla agent " by professor paui emmett of harvard university . " well , you' il be relieved to hear i' m not making a speech this evening . i just want to thank our wonderfui publishers , marty rhinehart and john maddox , and our attorney and friend , sidney kroll . and finally , but especially , mike mcara .
mike , our thoughts are with you . in these very difficult few months , i' ve drawn great comfort from this book , from knowing that , despite the terrible double tragedy of losing both of them , mike and adam did at least live long enough to complete it . and i really believe that , as people read these pages , adam' s voice will keep on coming through for generations to come , eloquent , strong and full of hope . thanks to his words , he is with us still . if i' ve left out anyone' s name , i hope you' il forgive me . but now i must make a toast . to the memory of a great man and a great patriot , a wonderfui husband and a devoted father . to adam !
